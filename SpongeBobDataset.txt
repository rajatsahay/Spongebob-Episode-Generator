[Following the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song, the brief opening titles show the names of creator Stephen Hillenburg, Derek Drymon and others. The episode opens with a bubble transition, and we see a coral reef under the sea. The camera zooms to initiate parallax scrolling, which reveals the city of Bikini Bottom. It continues zooming to show a brown rock, a Moai head, and a pineapple, which each contain inhabitants.]
French Narrator: Ah, the sea... so fascinating. So wonderful. Here, we see Bikini Bottom, teeming with life. [Shows from left to right Patrick's, Squidward's, and SpongeBob's houses. Zooms in on SpongeBob's house.] Home to one of my favorite creatures, SpongeBob SquarePants. Yes, of course he lives in a pineapple, you silly. [Scene cuts to the house's bedroom. A sea snail is seen sleeping near a pile of newspapers on the floor, a scallop is seen in a birdcage, and a young, optimistic sea sponge is seen sleeping in his bed, snoring as his foghorn alarm clock ticks. SpongeBob's alarm then sounds. He wakes, but is unaffected by the annoying sound, and with a smile on his face, turns it off. He climbs from his bed to a ladder, leading to his diving board.]
SpongeBob: Today's the big day, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [jumps on the diving board] Look at me, I'm... [jumps up, and leaves his underwear behind] ...naked! [Lands inside pants, walks over to exercise room. His head pops out of the top of his pants.] Gotta be in top physical condition for today, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [He goes inside his small gym room that has a sign that reads "I Love Pain." Taking deep breaths, he prepares to lift a barbell that is balanced by two lightweight stuffed animals. He sticks out his chest, but almost passes out because he can barely lift it. He drops it, and it makes a "squeak" noise] I'm ready! [runs outside] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! [A dimwitted sea star's rock tilts upwards with him stuck to its underside]
Patrick: Go, SpongeBob! [Patrick falls] Whoa! [crash sound effect]
SpongeBob: [runs down the street to the Krusty Krab] There it is. The finest eating establishment ever established for eating: The Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. With a Help Wanted sign in the window. For years I've been dreaming of this moment. I'm gonna go in there, march straight to the manager, look 'im straight in the eye [breaks the fourth wall and looks the audience in the eye], lay it on the line and... I can't do this! [He starts to run home, but Patrick stops him.] Uh, Patrick!
Patrick: Where do you think you're going?
SpongeBob: I was just...
Patrick: No you're not. You're going to the Krusty Krab and get that job.
SpongeBob: I can't, don't you see? I'm not good enough.
Patrick: Whose first words were "May I take your order"?
SpongeBob: Mine were.
Patrick: Who made a spatula out of toothpicks in wood shop?
SpongeBob: I did.
Patrick: [grimaces and contorts twice while trying to come up with a good third line] Who's a, uh, who's uhh, oh! Who's a big yellow cube with holes?
SpongeBob: I am.
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! [runs toward the Krusty Krab. An octopus is seen cleaning graffiti on the restaurant's windows.]
Squidward: [cleaning graffiti of himself with the word "loser," sees SpongeBob, and sighs] Oh no, SpongeBob. What could he possibly want?
SpongeBob: [in background, at first while Squidward was talking] I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, self! [Squidward looks at the Help Wanted sign, screams, and runs inside.]
Squidward: [While SpongeBob says, "I'm ready," one more time in the background] Mr. Krabs! [cuts to the ordering window, where a greedy crab is seen happily sniffing a handful of money. Squidward runs up to him.] Hurry, Mr. Krabs, before it's too late, I gotta tell you- [interrupted by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard, captain. [deep voice] I've been training my whole life for the day I could join the Krusty Krew [normal voice] and now I'm ready. [SpongeBob trips on a nail stuck in the floorboard. Mr. Krabs and Squidward look at each other. His fall causes him to bounce against the ceiling. SpongeBob shouts and blurts incomprehensibly while his bounces and ricochets around the building accelerate. He then rolls to a stop at the feet of Squidward and Mr. Krabs.] So, uh, when do I start?
Mr. Krabs: Well, lad, it looks like you don't even have your sea legs.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please. I'll prove I'm fry cook material. Ask Squidward, he'll vouch for me. [Mr. Krabs and Squidward quickly walk away from SpongeBob]
Squidward: [deep breath] No. [Mr. Krabs winks. They head back to SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Well, lad, we'll give you a test, and if you pass, you'll be on the Krusty Krew. Go out and fetch me... [SpongeBob takes out a notepad] a, uh, hydrodynamic spatula... [SpongeBob quickly jots down what he says] with, um, port-and-starboard-attachments, [more scribbling] and, uh... turbo drive. [more scribbling] And don't come back ‘til you get one. [Mr. Krabs puts a Krusty Krab crew hat on SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob sees how he looks in a mirror, there are sparkles on his hat, and he has a huge, satisfied smile]
SpongeBob: [saluting Krabs] Aye aye, captain! [reading] One hydrodynamic spatula, with port-and-starboard attachments, turbo drive, coming right up, Sir!
Mr. Krabs: Carry on! [SpongeBob leaves] We'll never see that lubber again.
Squidward: You're terrible. A hydro-what? [Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh. While Squidward laughs, his nose moves distinctly while he inhales and exhales. Krabs laugh sounds like a pirate. As they laugh, SpongeBob is shown leaving the Krusty Krab. As SpongeBob fades out of sight, five buses drive toward the Krusty Krab from the opposite direction.]
Bus driver: Hey! Hey! Please! Passengers are to stay seated and not put their hands out the window! [The buses surround the Krusty Krab and the doors open; Mr. Krabs stops laughing.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] That sounded like hatch doors. [sniffs repeatedly] Do you smell it? That smell. A kind of smelly smell. A smelly smell that smells... smelly. [his eyes widen] Anchovies.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: Anchovies! [Anchovies get out of the buses and rush inside the Krusty Krab, crowding, repeating the word "meep" over and over again]
Squidward: Please, please, quiet! [anchovies stop talking] Is this any way to behave, hmmm?
Anchovy: Meep!
Squidward: Could we show a little decency and form a neat, single file line in front of the register? [The anchovies stare for a moment, then pick up the boat, as their cries of "meep!" become more intense. Cut to Barg'N-Mart as SpongeBob enters.]
SpongeBob: [singing to himself]   Barg'N-Mart, meeting all of your spatula needs.   [cuts back to the Krusty Krab. Squidward and Mr. Krabs are still in the boat register, and being tossed around like a ship in a storm.]
Mr. Krabs: All hands on deck! Get your anchors out of your pants!
Squidward: One single file line was all I asked!
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! [Mr. Krabs and Squidward are thrown up in the air] Batten down the hatches, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again; the boat is in splinters] We're taking on water, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again, with Krabs clutching Squidward] I want my mommy, Mr. Squidward! [cuts to Barg'N-Mart]
SpongeBob: [singing]   Do do do do do do, spatula, spatula, port-and-starboard attachments.   [cuts back to the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Help!
Mr. Krabs: Man overboard! Climb, Mr. Squidward! Climb! [They climb the mast, while the anchovies try to get them down. The anchovies then form a big wave.]
Anchovies: Meep! Meep!
Mr. Krabs: This is the end! Goodbye, Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs! [They cry, then SpongeBob comes in with red lights flashing and flying with the spatula, singing a heroic tune]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard captain! Da da da da da da da! Da da da da da da da da da da! Did someone order a spatula?
Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [stuttering while shocked at the SpongeBob getting the hydrodynamic spatula]
SpongeBob: That's right! One hydrodynamic spatula with [two spatulas pop out on the sides of the previous one] port-and-starboard attachments! And lets not forget the turbo drive! [the two extending spatulas twirl around and smack Squidward and Mr. Krabs in the face] Would you believe they only had one in stock? To the kitchen! [to the anchovies] Who's hungry?! [Tiny Tim's "Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight" plays while SpongeBob serves up Krabby Patty after Krabby Patty. Numerous Krabby Patties are launched through the opening window to the hungry anchovies. Eventually, all of the anchovies are served and they leave on the buses. Cuts to later.]
Mr. Krabs: That was the finest fast-foodsmanship I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants. Welcome aboard. [Mr. Krabs gives SpongeBob a name tag]
Squidward: B-but, but, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for SpongeBob! Hip-hip!
Squidward: [weakly] Hooray, Mr.-
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip.
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray. M-
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip.
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray. Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: I'll be in my quarters, counting up the booty. [He wheels a wheelbarrow piled with an enormous stack of cash to his office. Patrick enters]
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew!
Squidward: What would you like to order, Patrick?
Patrick: One Krabby Patty, please. [The instrumental to "Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight" starts playing. SpongeBob flies back to the kitchen, using his spatula, and a score of Krabby Patties is immediately fired through the servery, which collide with Patrick and send him flying out of the Krusty Krab. Cuts to Krusty Krab exterior; crashing noises.]
Patrick: [screams]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [calmly and singing] Mr. Krabs, come see your new employee. 
quidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Squidward. May I take your order?
Clay: Hmmm... uhh... oh, I'll have a... [Squidward takes out a pencil and a paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and the paper away] Maybe... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and the paper away] Hmmm... I'll have... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. Or maybe...
Squidward: Are you planning on ordering today, sir?
Clay: I'll have a Krabby Patty. [Squidward writes down order]
Squidward: How original.
Clay: And with extra onions.
Squidward: Daring today, aren't we? [takes order and shows SpongeBob] One Krabby Patty, extra onions. [SpongeBob takes piece of paper and puts with the rest of the orders]
SpongeBob: One cryin' Johnny comin' up! First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up! [bell rings]
Squidward: Whatever. [John comes up and tells Squidward what he wants and Squidward relays order to SpongeBob] Twelve Krabby Patties on wheat buns! [SpongeBob takes a plate and patties begin to appear on the plate]
SpongeBob: [at rapid speed] Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up! [Squidward takes the plate]
Squidward: Thanks, Farmer Brown. [gives the plate to John] It's been a thrill serving you.
John: Can I get some extra salt?
Squidward: We're all out.
John: Could you check?
Squidward: No. [John glares at Squidward as he leaves. Bubble Bass walks up to order] Let me guess, tiny, a small salad?
Bubble Bass: I'll take a Double Triple Bossy Deluxe on a raft, four by four, animal-style, extra shingles with a shimmy and a squeeze, light axle grease, make it cry, burn it, and let it swim. [Squidward gives up writing all of that down]
Squidward: We serve food here, sir. [SpongeBob shows Squidward he has already gotten the order done]
SpongeBob: I got it already, Squidward. [gasps] Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: [pushes Squidward away] SquarePants. [walks to SpongeBob] I hear talk you make a mean Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [staring at Bubble Bass] Yep. I hear talk you're kinda picky.
Bubble Bass: Yep.
SpongeBob: Well then... here ya go! [Bubble Bass takes the plate and sits down where he examines the Krabby Patty until he decides to take a bite] Well, Bubble Bass, whaddaya think?
Bubble Bass: This is pretty good. Only one thing. You forgot the pickles! [shows no pickles on the patty]
Crowd: [gasp]
SpongeBob: No!
Bubble Bass: The best there is? I don't think so. You lose! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [checks patty for pickles] But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on! [customers are disappointed; tears the patty apart, finding the pickles] Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles? [Bubble Bass walks up to Mr. Krabs, but also throws Squidward out of the way again]
Bubble Bass: I believe you owe me two bucks.
Mr. Krabs: Two bucks?!
Bubble Bass: Your guarantee. [points to the menu where in tiny print it says 'money-back guarantee']
Mr. Krabs: Oh. That. Well, can't we talk about this? [takes out two dollars and Bubble Bass grabs it]
Bubble Bass: No.
Mr. Krabs: [pulls money back] How about a discount on restroom tokens? [Bubble Bass takes money back]
Bubble Bass: Afraid not.
Mr. Krabs: How's about a free glass of water? A dozen free glasses of water! I'll even put ice in it! [Bubble Bass walks out the Krusty Krab with the money] No! Come back! Two dollars! Two dollars, no! No! [walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] That two bucks is comin' out of your paycheck! [SpongeBob tries to hang onto the floor]
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! Wait! [Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, we got orders waitin'!
Squidward: I need a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Okay, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let's see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then pickles? No! That's not right! [starts a new patty] Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the pickles? No! [tries again] Mustard down, bun stuff down, d'oh, where's the patty go? [tries again and uses the same bun] Pickles, ketchup, wait! Think! Think! I'm losin' it! [tries again] Bun down, shoe, mustard, pan, bun... no! [Mr. Krabs comes in] Mr. Krabs, I am so confused. I can't remember how to do anything.
Mr. Krabs: Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't worry about that. We've got Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? What? [SpongeBob walks out and goes home]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup... [looks up and notices door is not there] The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing! [Mr. Krabs opens door a couple feet away] Oh. [laughs] Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better go on home and rest my brain. [walks out] Uhh, which way do I live? [Mr. Krabs points the path] Of course. [laughs. Later, we see SpongeBob in his house trying to write down the formula] No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomatoes, pickles, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No. Shoe? [throws paper and pencil away] I am so confused! Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get my head on straight. [at night]
SpongeBob: Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or... [hits his head with his fist] D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow. [gets in between the two mattresses] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Aw, this isn't right. [he slips out and stands upside-down on his bed] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Wait, this isn't right either. [SpongeBob lays down on his back] Nope. [SpongeBob is between each railing of the ladder] Nuh-uh. [tries sleeping with a mattress on his head] Negative. [tries sleeping on the ground next to his mattresses] C'mon, c'mon! Get it right. [tries in the lifesaver] Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet! [keeps doing the wrong things as the clock fast-forwards to morning where the alarm goes off. SpongeBob is under all three mattresses on the floor] Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! [picks up Gary and shoves him in the foghorn alarm where it is still going off. At The Krusty Krab]
Squidward: [there is black smoke coming from kitchen. Squidward clears the smoke off with a fire extinguisher] Patties are done. [Mr. Krabs notices black, burnt patties and gets irritated]
Mr. Krabs: Urrgh! [Turns backwards from the counter after hearing customers starting to complain]
Unknown Anchovy: Hey, he burnt my Krabby Patty.
Martha: He burnt my fries!
Billy: [Briefly drinks his burnt shake until realizing it is burnt.] He burnt my shake.
All customers: [all yelling and mumbling]
Mr. Krabs: No! Come back! No! No! Urrgh... I gotta get SpongeBob back!
[cuts to SpongeBob's house, he nailed a toaster to the door]
Mr. Krabs: [opens door] SpongeBob?
[music playing in reverse; the house is a total disaster as everything is misplaced and things are everywhere and opposite]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [now he has underwear on his head] Mr. Krabs, hello. Do you how do?
Mr. Krabs: Why you talkin' funny, lad? [takes the underwear off SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: I anything can't do right since because pickles.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, you'll be back makin' Krabby Patties like your old self in no time!
SpongeBob: I think don't ready back to go to work, Mr. Krabs. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: But you're fine, me boy! [SpongeBob walks right through the wooden kitchen door] Ohh... uhh, well... maybe not. [walks into the kitchen where SpongeBob is nailing a piece of bread to the table] All we need to do is get your confidence back. So, you can make me more money! I-I-I mean, patties. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: I how do that?
Mr. Krabs: It's like riding a bike. You never forget! [notices a bike in a boiling pot of water on the stove] Uhh... I'm gonna help ya! [shown both of them sitting on the ground in SpongeBob's living room] If you learn to make a Krabby Patty again, your life will be back in order. [takes out a blanket with all the ingredients on it]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don't know if I...
Mr. Krabs: Take your time. [SpongeBob thinks of the Krabby Patty formula. It soon turns to night then day again. SpongeBob reaches for a bun and Mr. Krabs gets excited. SpongeBob puts bun back down]
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no. [Day becomes night again. Then day again and then night again. Mr. Krabs is sleeping until SpongeBob wakes him up] I got it! I got it! It's all very clear to me now, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: It is?
SpongeBob: Yes! I finally realize that I can't do it! I can't do it, Mr. Krabs! I'm a failure!
Mr. Krabs: Don't talk like that!
SpongeBob: Don't you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate? I can't make a Double Krabby Patty with the works! [Makes patty as he tells Mr. Krabs the ingredients] I can't put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order! [notices the Krabby Patty he just made, was in the correct order]
Mr. Krabs: It's time.
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk back to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob rescued Squidward from the burning kitchen and extinguishes him, too.]
Unnamed fish: Hey, SpongeBob's back! [men and women are cheering]
Bubble Bass: I hear SquarePants is back! [SpongeBob opens the kitchen door]
SpongeBob: I'm right here, Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: I thought I ran you out of town. [spits a loogie into a bucket]
SpongeBob: This is where I belong! [holds up bubbles and blows one] .
Bubble Bass: [Gives a weird sounding roar]
SpongeBob: Rawr.
[The crowd gasps. SpongeBob and Bubble Bass glare at each other, while Mr. Krabs is sweating with anticipation]
Bubble Bass: Give me the regular. And this time, don't forget the pickles.
SpongeBob: [rushes into the kitchen and comes back with a Krabby Patty in the blink of an eye] I didn't.
[Mr. Krabs is violently sweating as Bubble Bass examines and eats the patty]
Bubble Bass: Hmm... ...Still no pickles! [SpongeBob notices] See? [sticks out his tongue with all the chewed up food on it. Everyone is getting sick at the sight of it and they’re disgusted] You failed again, SpongeBob "Loser"Pants! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Wait a minute! [grabs Bubble Bass' tongue and pulls it out] Look! [shows four pickles under Bubble Bass' tongue] He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!
Mr. Krabs: And there's the pickles from last time, too!
Shubie: And there's my car keys! [everyone walks up to Bubble Bass, all glaring at him]
Bubble Bass: And... there's my ride! [runs out the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for the return of our master fry cook, SpongeBob! Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Hooray.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Whoop-de-doo.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Oh, boy.
SpongeBob: And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone: Squidward! [Squidward smiles] Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Squidward is shocked and frowns. The frown becomes more droopier with each "Boo"]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Scene changes to outside of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo!
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
Customer: Boo! You stink!
Squidward: [The scene starts at the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob cleaning a table] Hurry up with those chairs, SpongeBob. It's after closing and I'd like to go home!
[phone rings]

SpongeBob: I got it, I got it! Coming. [leaps for the phone but Squidward answers it first. SpongeBob falls to the floor and exclaims]
Squidward: Hello? Sorry, sir, we're close... [Mr. Krabs snatches phone]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there, Krusty Krab. How could I help you? [customer explains order over phone] Pizza? [eyes turn into dollar signs] Um... Of course we have pizza.
Squidward: Uhh, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Our delivery squid will bring it right over. [hangs up]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizza. [Mr. Krabs gets a plate of Krabby patties and turns it into pizza. Then he puts it in a box] We don't deliver.
Mr. Krabs: We don't deliver, [gives Squidward the pizza] but you do.
Squidward: Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it?
Mr. Krabs: Great idea! Take him with you. [SpongeBob sneaks over smiling big]
Squidward: That's not what I had in mind!
SpongeBob: Front end... check. Antenna... [touches the boat antenna making it vibrate] check. Bumper... check. Bumper sticker... [bumper sticker says "I Brake For Sea Urchins"] ...check. [uncaps the tire pressure and puts his mouth in it, causing him to inflate like a balloon, and talk in a squeaky, high pitched voice while he is now the size of a giant parade balloon] Tire pressure! [blows out the rest of the pressure in Squidward's face, returning him to his normal size and voice] ...check. Vehicle inspection complete! We're really making history here, Squidward. That lucky customer is going to get the first Krabby Patty Pizza ever!
Squidward: Good, then you drive.
SpongeBob: I can't. I'm still in Boating School.
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob. It's just around the corner.
SpongeBob: Well, yeah, but...
Squidward: Just do what you do in school.
SpongeBob: Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me.
Squidward: Back it up.
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Back... it up.
SpongeBob: Right, back... it up. [tries to move the stick shift down]
Squidward: Back it up!
SpongeBob: Okay, okay.
Squidward: Shift into reverse, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse. [SpongeBob imagines the words "FORWARD" and "BACKWARD" turning into Korean characters, 앞으로가 (FORWARD) and 뒤로가 (BACKWARD)]
Squidward: Back it up!
SpongeBob: [shifts gears] Backing up! Backing up! [boat backs up really fast]
Squidward: [tries to get the wheel] Gimme the wheel, SpongeBob. Give me the wheel!
SpongeBob: Backing up! Backing up! Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ack-i-i-i-i-i-ng up! [they go over a bumpy area with rocks and then they spin around and around and around, screaming. The next morning, the boat goes over five hills] Backing up. Backing up. Backing up. [boat stops with no fuel left] Backing up.
Squidward: Well... you backed up. And you know what? I think we're out of gas. And you know what else? [echoing] We're in the middle of nowhere!
SpongeBob: And you know what else else? I think the pizza's getting cold.
Squidward: And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold. Not the pizza! Oh, how could it get any worse?! [kicks boat and the boat's gasoline becomes full again and it drives away into the distance without them]
SpongeBob: Well, we can still deliver it on foot. [Squidward narrows his eyes. Later, both walk on the sand]
Squidward: Ow, ow, ow.
SpongeBob: [singing] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza...
Squidward: ...And my feet are killing me. Whoa. [trips over SpongeBob, who is lying on the ground] SpongeBob? What are you doing?
SpongeBob: [rubbing the ground] It's an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once.
Squidward: SpongeBob, this is no time for...
SpongeBob: Shh, shh, shh. It's working.
Squidward: What is it?
SpongeBob: [pointing to the road] Truck! Sixteen wheels. Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhiked. [starts dancing in the road while wearing a hat] Whee... eee... [Squidward sits on a rock while playing with a wooden spoon]
Truck Driver: Crashin' frashin' break dancers! [honks his truck]
Squidward: He's stopping! He's stopping! [Squidward realizes he's not stopping and grabs SpongeBob out of the way where they are covered in sand thanks to the truck. Squidward narrows his eyes at the smiling SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob and Squidward are now in a place with heavy winds] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza [The wind blows on Squidward's nose making it touch his face so he puts it down, only for it to touch his face again so he puts it in his mouth.] is the pizza free delivery. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty. [SpongeBob gets carried around in the air by the huge winds]
Squidward: Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?!
SpongeBob: [still being carried around in the air] I can't, it's for the customer!
Squidward: Well, who cares about the customer?!
SpongeBob: I do!
Squidward: Well, I don't!
SpongeBob: [wind stops and SpongeBob gasps] Squidward! [starts flying again]
Squidward: Let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! [runs over Squidward]
Squidward: Ow. [holding SpongeBob's legs] SpongeBob, let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! It's for the customer!
Squidward: SpongeBob! Let go of the pizza! [lifts up into the tornado]
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob! [looks down] Hang onto the pizza! [tornado spits them both out. SpongeBob uses the pizza as a parachute but Squidward falls hard onto the ground] Hey! Hey! [crawls up to the screen] Where's the road? Where's the road? [a tumbleweed rolls by] We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go? [SpongeBob lands] What are we gonna do now! There's no road here!
SpongeBob: I think town's this way. [points]
Squidward: Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers?
SpongeBob: That's right. [points to a mossy rock] Moss always points to civilization.
Squidward: That way? That way there? [SpongeBob nods] So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way?
SpongeBob: [nods again] Yep.
Squidward: Well, then I'm going this way. [heads the other way]
SpongeBob: Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think...
Squidward: Trust me, I know where I'm going. [Pans out to show another city in the other direction]
SpongeBob: [sings] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, absolutivally. [later] pizza... [starts beatboxing] pizza... [later, SpongeBob is walking backwards. SpongeBob's pants almost split into two and move up and down simultaneously while he continues to beatbox. Still later] Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, yeah, for you and [falsetto] me! [later] Krab Pizza... for you. Krus... the Krusshy and the... Krab and the... pizza inside. [Later, they are both lying face down in the sand]
Squidward: Sponge, we gotta eat something.
SpongeBob: I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral. [Squidward eats some coral] No, maybe it wasn't coral. [Squidward spits out the coral] Maybe it was sand, no, no, mud.
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: Wait, I remember now. It was coral!
Squidward: Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No, we promised it's for the customer.
Squidward: [fancy music plays] You're right. It's for the customer.
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: Maybe we better check on it, make sure it's okay.
SpongeBob: Well?
Squidward: Just a peek. [opens box]
SpongeBob: [he shuts it quickly] Okay, it's fine.
Squidward: No, I think I saw something. [opens box] Oh, no. I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine-looking pizza.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: What's that? Is that the cheese?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: And the pepperoni?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: [SpongeBob slurps] Oh, looks good, huh?
SpongeBob: Wait a second, I know what you're trying to do, Squidward. [closes box] I'm not letting you eat the pizza!
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Get away!
Squidward: [chases SpongeBob] Get back here, SpongeBob, give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Wait! [he becomes too tired to run]
SpongeBob: No! No! [runs into Squidward]
Squidward: I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over one way or another!
SpongeBob: Look, we're saved!
Squidward: Sure, we're saved. Now give me some pizza!
SpongeBob: No, really Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved! [he jumps in and out of his pants]
Squidward: Will you cut that out?!
SpongeBob: [to a conga beat] Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! [rips himself apart then the two parts go in circles and then they connect again. SpongeBob starts doing a conga dance] Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, we are saved!
Squidward: That's just a stupid boulder!
SpongeBob: It's not just a boulder. [sniff] It's a rock. [cries] A rock! A rock! Its a big beautiful, old rock. [climbs up it and rubs it] Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape.
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae! And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive... [SpongeBob runs over Squidward with the boulder] ...rocks? Hold on there, Jethro!
SpongeBob: [they stop outside the customer's house] I can't wait to see the look on our customer’s face! [rings doorbell]
Tom: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Congratulations, sir. Your Krabby Patty pizza is here!
Tom: Wow, thanks! I've been dying for one of these. It... [brief pause] Where's my drink?
SpongeBob: [confused] What drink?
Tom: [in an angry tone] My drink? My diet Dr. Kelp? Don't tell me you forgot my drink!
SpongeBob: [checks through the order] But, you didn't order any...
Tom: [yelling] How am I supposed to eat this pizza without my drink?!
SpongeBob: But... but... [tears start rolling down his face]
Tom: Didn't you ever once think of the customer?! [throws the pizza at SpongeBob's face] You call yourself a delivery boy?! Well, I ain't buying! [slams the door. SpongeBob goes over to Squidward, smiling and trying not to cry]
Squidward: Sponge? Sponge? It's okay. Sponge? [SpongeBob drops the pizza, falls over, starts sobbing, and absorbs his tears over and over] Sponge? [Squidward gets angry, grabs the pizza, stomps towards the customer's house and pounds on the door]
Tom: [answers the door, still angry] Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't paying for that!
Squidward: [Tom's point of view] Well, this one's on the house! [slams the pizza box in Tom's face]
SpongeBob: [still crying] Did he change his mind?
Squidward: [smugly] He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite.
SpongeBob: [stops crying] No drink?
Squidward: Nah. Now take me home. [jumps up on the rock]
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work. [backs up the rock where they are instantly at the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Work? [screen cuts to black] Oh, my aching tentacles!
SpongeBob: Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahhh, what a beautiful day! [SpongeBob's hand appears from a sand castle pineapple with his face drawn on his hand] I wonder if Patrick's at home.
Patrick: Hiya, SpongeBob! [Patrick's hand comes over from a sand castle rock with his face drawn on his hand] Whatcha doin'?
SpongeBob: Goin' over to Sandy's place. [both hands walk off together and arrive at a sand-made treedome] Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place.
Sandy: Don't lose your barnacles, boys. Hi-yah! [Chops sand castle peak down making a sand image of Texas] There it is!
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: Can't you see? It's Texas.
SpongeBob: Texas? What's a Texas? [a wave covers sand and ruins Sandy's Texas display]
Sandy: Ohh, it's nothing but a memory now.
SpongeBob: All right then. Let's make one of your treedome.
Sandy: You know, all of a sudden, I don't feel like sand castles, SpongeBob. I'll see y'all later. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Sandy? Hi-yah!
Sandy: Aww, SpongeBob, I'm not feeling up to karate now.
SpongeBob: Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy. [Turns around] Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah! [grabs Don the Whale from behind and flips him over onto the ground. Don growls like a dog and punches SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Sandy? [surfs in the air] Surf's up, Sandy!
Sandy: No, thanks. [enters Jellyfish Fields. Jellyfish are heard buzzing]
SpongeBob: [Runs after a jellyfish with a net] Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing! [Patrick runs after one while laughing, then falls on his face. He gets up and runs again]
SpongeBob: Look, Sandy, we caught one!
Sandy: Listen, SpongeBob. Right now, I don't want to build sand castles, play karate, or eat jellyfish.
SpongeBob: [laughs] We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!
Patrick: Fly away, little critter!
SpongeBob: Go on, go back to where you belong. [the jellyfish flies away as Sandy watches teary-eyed] Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them. Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind. Remember: there's no place like home! [Sandy cries filling her helmet with tears. She takes a flusher handle and attaches it to her helmet, then she pulls it down and all the water drains out. Sandy gasps for air and pants] Sandy, what the heck are you crying about?
Sandy: I ain't crying! My helmet just sprung a leak!
SpongeBob: [suspicious] Sandy...
Sandy: [confessing] Oh, I guess I'm just feeling a little homesick.
SpongeBob: Homesick, huh? [SpongeBob thinks, and later, Sandy is blindfolded as SpongeBob and Patrick take her somewhere] Almost there.
Sandy: Heck gum it, SpongeBob, what is it?
SpongeBob: Da-ta-dah. [the three are standing outside the Treedome]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Welcome home, Sandy!
[pause. Sandy cries and runs into the treedome]
SpongeBob: Sandy?
Sandy: Go away. [pulls a lever which brings down a metal covering on the treedome]
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Patrick! What's wrong with Sandy?
Patrick: Maybe it's just a squirrel thing. [a hole opens up in the top of the dome and Sandy comes out wearing a cowgirl hat and holding a guitar. Sandy tunes it]
Sandy:  Wish I was back in Texas. The ocean's no place for a squirrel.  [live action Texas scenery appears behind her]  Wish I was in Texas, prettiest place in the world oh no. I guess that deep in my heart, I'll always be a Texas girl. I wanna go hooooooooooooooome, home.  [some clams howl along. SpongeBob and Patrick hear the music]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick, do you hear that? [Patrick has the notes going around him]
Patrick: Arrrgh! Get them off me! Get them off me!
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, listen. It's Sandy.
Sandy:  I wanna wake up in Texas.  [live action scenery is shown]  I miss those wide open skies. I miss my twenty acres, barbecues and pecan pies, oh, why? When I'm so far from you Texas, all I can do is cry.  [a live-action squirrel sheds a tear. SpongeBob and Patrick start sobbing. At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs hears the song, too, and starts sobbing also and accidentally gets hit by the cash register.]
Fish #1, #2, #3: Please Make It Stop! [Two customers are also sobbing; one dries his eyes with his Krabby Patty and gives it to the next person who blows his nose on it]
Sandy:  I wanna go hoooommme.  [Junior Brown's voice]  I wanna go home.  [as she sings she goes back into the Treedome. SpongeBob and Patrick continue sobbing and then stop]
Patrick: Do you think she knows the Muffin Man song?
SpongeBob: Patrick, she sang that song from her heart. She really misses Texas.
Patrick: Well, let's get some Texas and bring it down here!
SpongeBob: Patrick, we can't...that's it! Patrick, your genius is showing!
Patrick: [mishears, and frantically covers himself] Where?
[Later, SpongeBob and Patrick have gotten everything ready at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Everything looks perfect. We're going to get Sandy now.
Mr. Krabs: [from inside] Well, hurry up, lads! We can't squat like this forever!
[at Sandy's house where SpongeBob & Patrick are playing leapfrog while going to her treedome]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Sandy's surprise is at the Krusty Krab!
Patrick: Wait until she sees the...
SpongeBob: Shh! Don't spoil the surprise! [SpongeBob knocks, Sandy opens her door]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hey, Sandy!
SpongeBob: You want to come with us to the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: [walks out with two suitcases] Hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob: What are you doing with those bags?
Sandy: I'm going back home to Texas.
SpongeBob: What?! Now?! You can't! I mean we...
Sandy: It's time for this tumbleweed to tumble on home.
SpongeBob: Wait, Sandy! You can't! Uhh, we we're gonna...the...the...Krusty Krab...that is not the right direction! Wait, if you don't...if I can't...augh! Sandy! Wait a second! You don't wanna leave without having one last Krabby Patty down at the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: I'm tired of fish food, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: But, Sandy, don't you want to say goodbye to all your friends down at the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: [gets on a bus] I just can't do that, SpongeBob. It'd be too sad.
SpongeBob: No, no! Wait! Sandy! [the bus drives off] I can't believe she's gone.
Patrick: Yeah. What's so great about dumb ol' Texas? [the bus suddenly speeds back; the doors open revealing a very angry Sandy]
Sandy: What did you say?
Patrick: Texas is dumb?
Sandy: [the bus drives off again] Don't you dare take the name of Texas in vain!
SpongeBob: You mean we can't say anything bad about dumb ol' Texas?
Sandy: No, you can't!
Patrick: Then can we say people from Texas are dumb?
Sandy: No! You can't say nothing about Texas!
SpongeBob: [gets an idea] Oh, so you mean we can't say anything bad about... [turns around; grabs his behind and shakes it and rolls eyes] Texas!
Sandy: [blushes angrily] I'm warnin' you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, I'm Texas! Duh, howdy, y'all! Howdy y'all!
Patrick: I'm Texas, too! Git a dog, little longie! Git a dog!
SpongeBob: Howdy y'all!
Patrick: Git a dog, little longie! Git a dog!
Sandy: Y'all best cut it out!
SpongeBob: [while Patrick does armpit farts] The stars at night are dull and dim, whenever they have to be over dumb ol' stupid Texas! [Sandy gets steaming mad. SpongeBob turns into the shape of Texas] Hey, Patrick, what am I now?
Patrick: Uhh, stupid?
SpongeBob: No, I'm Texas!
Patrick: What's the difference?! [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh]
Sandy: [drops suitcases] Y'all best apologize, or I'm gonna be on you like ugly on an ape!
SpongeBob: You'll have to catch us first! [SpongeBob and Patrick run off] We did it! We got her!
Patrick: Krusty Krab, here we come! [turns head around to Sandy] Can we say that plants from Texas are dumb? Can we say that shoes from Texas are dumb?
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, that's enough.
Patrick: Why? You think that old slowpoke Texas is gonna... [...catch up, which she is. And fast. Patrick's eyes bug out and he screams]
SpongeBob: Run faster, Patrick! [both of them scream; they go around each side of a huge rock. Sandy crashes right through the rock, obliterating it, and walks with a twirling rope. Her shoe engulfs the screen, Sandy ropes Patrick and brings him into the background]
Patrick: [screams] SpongeBob! [Nuclear explosion is heard and a mushroom cloud appears. SpongeBob screams. SpongeBob stops in front of a leaf and shakes as Sandy karate chops the leaf and SpongeBob in half]
Sandy: Hi-yah! [SpongeBob jumps with his halves and he gets back together] Y'all gonna take back what ya said!
SpongeBob: No! Almost there! [runs toward the Krusty Krab. Sandy's rope turns into the shape of SpongeBob; SpongeBob screams. As he jumps for the Krusty Krab, Sandy throws her rope. SpongeBob hangs onto the door as Sandy pulls him towards her]
Sandy: SpongeBob, you've been messing with the bull! Now here come the horns!
SpongeBob: Sandy, no! [the front of the Krusty Krab tears off as Sandy has pulled tight enough]
Everyone: Howdy, y'all!
Sandy: Wha-what's this?
SpongeBob: It's a party!
Patrick: [hops over with arms and legs tied and covered in bandages] For you!
Sandy: For me?!
SpongeBob: It's your own little slice of Texas! Check it out, Sandy! We got square dancing... [Flats is holding a square] ...giant Barbecues... [Squidward is holding a sharp, spiky Q]
Squidward: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
SpongeBob: ...homemade peas-in-a-can pie... [Pearl is holding a pie with a can of peas in it] ...and we got our very own 10 gallon hats! [SpongeBob and Patrick put ten gallon water jugs on their heads] So, what do ya think? Are you gonna stay?
[Sandy starts to laugh and tears of laughter spew out and fill her helmet. Everyone frowns as tears start to well up in SpongeBob and Patrick's eyes']
SpongeBob: Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags.
Sandy: [takes out the flusher handle, attaches it to her helmet and flushes the water out again] I'm not crying, I'm laughing! I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you're surrounded by critters that care about ya. [Everyone gathers around Sandy]
Sandy: Huh? Duh. What am I doing? I was home all along, and it took me until now to realize it.
SpongeBob: Does that mean you'll stay?
Sandy: I'm staying! [Everyone cheers, except Squidward]
SpongeBob: That makes me feel all wiggly.
Patrick: Yeah, who needs dumb ol' Texas? [cheering stops; cut back to the Bikini Atoll]
Sandy: What did you just say?!
Patrick: Should I start running now?
Squidward: Wow. Squidward, this is the best soufflé you have ever created. [blows kiss] Congratulations, chef! [gets dressed, takes a shower, gargles, and brushes his teeth. He re-enters the scene in a tuxedo and sits down at the table. He hears laughter from outside. He goes to the window and notices that SpongeBob and Patrick are playing with bubbles. SpongeBob whispers into a bubble and it floats over to Patrick and pops]
SpongeBob Bubble: Hi, Patrick.
[Patrick giggles as he was about to blow a bubble. He eats the bubble and whispers into another bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob where it pops]
Patrick Bubble: Hi, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob giggles and Squidward, now annoyed, blows a bubble of his own from the liquid of his soufflé with a fork. SpongeBob whispers into another bubble]
SpongeBob: [whispering into bubble] Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood.
[the bubble floats over but is kicked when Squidward's bubble approaches, popping SpongeBob's bubble. Squidward's bubble floats over to Patrick and pops]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Patrick, you are the dumbest idiot it has ever been my misfortune to know.
[Patrick frowns and blows a bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Do you really think that, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [whispering into the bubble] Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that. [the bubble floats over to Patrick and pops, followed by another bubble floating back over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Yeah? Well, I think you're ugly. [another bubble comes over and pops] Yellow is ugly! [two other bubbles, but smaller, float over and pops, both containing raspberry noises for SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [talks into the bubble, puzzled] Patrick, what are you talking about?
[The bubble floats over to Patrick. Another bubble of Squidward's bubbles floats over to SpongeBob and pops]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] SpongeBob, I no longer wish to know you. [SpongeBob gasps] You give bottom dwellers a bad name.
[Squidward creates several other bubbles and they float over to SpongeBob]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] If I had a dollar for every brain you don't have, I'd have one dollar!
[Squidward laughs. Another bubble floats over to Patrick]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Hey, Patrick, I heard there was a job opening down at the pet shop... as some newspaper!
Patrick: [stands up and yells at SpongeBob] Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!
SpongeBob: [stands up and yells at Patrick] Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!
Patrick: Right, you're a turkey!
SpongeBob: What's that? [Squidward arrives outside with a lawn chair and his soufflé]
Patrick: It's what you are!
[Squidward begins to laugh hysterically at SpongeBob and Patrick's arguing.]
SpongeBob: Well, you're a bigger one!
Patrick: Well, you're still yellow! And you know what else is yellow?
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: You are!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? Well, it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway! [he goes inside through the back door and turns around] Aww, tartar sauce! [shuts door]
[Patrick angrily opens his rock, which closes and comes up sounding like an accordion. ]
Squidward: [Laughs at Patrick. Puts the soufflé and fork in his mouth.] [Continues laughing. Moves his tentacles around in laughter, then lies back in laughter accidentally swallowing the fork and choking on it. Chokes on the fork repeatedly and his skin turns to a deep shade of blue as the letters "K" and "O" appear in his right eye and left eye respectively and flashes appears. Squidward passes out and drools]
Patrick: Wow, Squidward, you're choking! [runs over to Squidward] Uhh... uhh, I know what to do, but I should wash my hands first. Oh, well. [he takes a deep breath and performs CPR on Squidward. As he is doing this, each one of Squidward's tentacles suction cups pops up. Eventually, the fork comes out and Patrick catches it] I win!
Squidward: Wow! Patrick, you saved me!
Patrick: I did?
Squidward: Yup! You're a real lifesaver, friend! [shakes Patrick's hands]
Patrick: Friend? [holds Squidward] Friend...
Squidward: [uneasily] Yeah, Patrick, we're friends... [steps back] just friends. [they both notice SpongeBob is gazing from his window with a blank stare]
Patrick: So what are we gonna do tonight, best friend? [walks with Squidward over to the Easter Island head]
Squidward: Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo.
Patrick: Clarinet? I love music!
[inside the pineapple, SpongeBob watches the two go inside Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary? [Gary is sleeping inside his shell] Gary? [knocks on his shell]
[cut to Squidward's]
Squidward: Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor.
Patrick: [sitting on a bench while clapping] Yeah! E minor! All right! Yeah! [Squidward takes a deep breath and plays a note, and Patrick immediately falls asleep, to the annoyance of Squidward. Scene cuts to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat! [he holds up three fingers] Uhh... [he draws faces on each finger with a broken smile] The gang's all here... [he looks at the faces on his fingers, and his eyes well with tears] Ohhh!
[Squidward is dragging Patrick, who is still asleep, outside. Suddenly, after a few feet, his back gives out]
Squidward: Ow! Oh! My back! I threw out my back!
SpongeBob: [sees Squidward in pain] Oh, boy, now's my chance! [jumps out of the window]
Squidward: SpongeBob? No, no, stay back!
SpongeBob: [running] Don't worry, Squidward! I'm coming!
Squidward: No, no, no, get away from me!
SpongeBob: Hang on! I'll save you! [rips off his suit revealing a speedo underneath]
Squidward: [tries to get to his door] No, no! Get away from me! No, no!
SpongeBob: [jumps off a diving board] Hold on!
Squidward: No, no! Get away! [screams as SpongeBob dives into his back cracking it back into place] Oh! I'm ruined! I'm... I'm... I'm... I-I feel great! Thanks, SpongeBob! You're a real friend! [SpongeBob smiles big]
SpongeBob: Friend...
Squidward: N-no, no, no, I didn't mean that, no-no.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squiddy, old pal. That's what friends are for. [Squidward and SpongeBob walk into the Easter Island head] So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh? Some friend. A real friend would perform for you!
Squidward: You play?
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I've been playing bassinet for years! [he takes one from the wall] Give me an A, buddy! [Squidward plays a note and SpongeBob sings] Squidward is my best friend in the world. [grates strings with bow] Squidward is my best friend in the sea...
[The bow flies into what looks like Squidward's head and he screams. Fortunately, it turns out it's just a painting; the real Squidward pulls the bow out and growls as he snaps it in half with his knee]
SpongeBob: [now playing with his fingers like a guitar] Squidward...
Patrick: [pops in through the window] Likes Patrick more than SpongeBob. [SpongeBob slams the window in Patrick's face] Oh!
SpongeBob: [strums harder before slamming the bass to the floor] And Patrick is a dirty, stinky, rotten friend stealer! [smashes the bass] Umm, I can fix this. [Squidward is steaming red in fury]
Squidward: Grrrrrryehhhhherrrryeh! [he kicks SpongeBob out]
SpongeBob: ...So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me!
Squidward: Yech! That was disgusting! I feel like I need to scrub myself. [opens up the curtain and screams after he sees Patrick in his tub]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. I warmed it up for ya. [shows him a brush and soap]
Squidward: Patrick! Get out! And put some clothes on! [SpongeBob peeks in through the upstairs window]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy? [notices Patrick in the bath-tub] Oh, ho-ho! So this is what I find, huh?! My best friend and my ex-best friend and... [shown bath toys] ...rubber bath toys!
Patrick: [simultaneously] Oh, yeah?! Well, he was my friend first!
SpongeBob: [simultaneously] You're just a backbiting, backstabbing silly blob of...
Squidward: [screams] This can't be happening to me! [He runs away. SpongeBob and Patrick stop their arguing as they notice Squidward's gone]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
SpongeBob: Buddy!
Patrick: Squidward, where are you?!
SpongeBob: Where'd ya go, friend?
Patrick: Where are ya, ol' buddy?
Squidward: [hiding in a trash can] Oh, this is nuts! I need a plan to get those two back together and outta my hair!
SpongeBob: [reading a magazine as the doorbell rings a letter is pushed under the door. Then he smells it] Squidward. [opens it] A dinner party? I'd love to! [SpongeBob knocks on Squidward's door and Squidward opens it] Did you miss me?
Squidward: Come on in! You look stunning. [shuts door]
SpongeBob: I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy... [gasps when he sees Patrick] Say, what gives?! I'm not sitting near that maniac!
Patrick: Me neither! This was a setup!
Squidward: I thought you two were my best friends.
SpongeBob and Patrick: I am your best friend!
Squidward: [takes out a bottle of soda] Well, how about some soda, guys? [SpongeBob shows him his glass]
SpongeBob: Yes, please! [Squidward gives him some soda] Thanks, friend. [flicks Squidward's nose] [drinks]
Patrick: How about some for your best friend? [SpongeBob puts his glass in front of Patrick's, so he gets the soda instead of Patrick]
SpongeBob: Thanks, best friend! [drinks]
Patrick: Can I have some now, buddy?
SpongeBob: Wait, I need some more! [pours SpongeBob another glass]
Patrick: I still didn't get any! [SpongeBob gives Patrick his soda]
SpongeBob: There ya go. More please! [Squidward fills his glass as SpongeBob drinks it really fast]
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward! [shows Squidward his glass again, but it's still full] Squidward!
Squidward: Patrick! Your glass is full!
Patrick: Oh, yeah...
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both show Squidward their glasses] Squidward!
Squidward: Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop. I'm gonna go get some more. [walks away] Why don't you just stay here and chat? [closes door. Then we see SpongeBob and Patrick. They are extremely fat and not wanting to look at each other. Then SpongeBob hiccups and a bubble floats up and pops that sounds like a burp. Both of them laugh and the entire house is full of bubbles as Squidward walks up to his door with a grocery bag. Then an explosion and crashing sounds are heard] I should just walk away right now. [opens door to find his house destroyed] What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today? [pieces around the door break]
SpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? [both hug]
Patrick: Me and SpongeBob are friends again!
Squidward: Great, now go be friends somewhere else.
SpongeBob: Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?
Squidward: No! Out! [both walk out]
SpongeBob: Psst, I think he's jealous.
Patrick: How pathetic. [Squidward shuts door hard and when he turns around as a bubble comes and pops on the door which causes the door to fall on his back]
Squidward: Ohhhhh, my back.
[At Glove World! Where SpongeBob and Patrick are standing outside the amusement park]
SpongeBob: [Patrick is licking a glove-shaped lollipop] Another funtastic day at Glove World! [bus stops at the bus stop and both of them get in, but SpongeBob struggles for a bit with his balloon]
Bus Driver: Ahem. [points to coin deposit]
SpongeBob: Let me get my wallet. [turns around and the balloon hits the bus driver's face] Wait, let me check this pocket. [turns around and the balloon hits him again] No... [turns around and the balloon hits the bus driver again] Patrick? Do you have any change?
Patrick: How much do you need?
SpongeBob: How much is it?
Bus Driver: Fifty cents.
SpongeBob: [turns around and the balloon smacks the bus driver in the back of his head] Fifty cents.
Patrick: Nope.
SpongeBob: [turns around and balloon smacks bus driver again] Lemme check my other poc-
Bus Driver: Forget it!
SpongeBob: [turns around and balloon smacks bus driver again] What did you say?
Bus Driver: Just take your seat!
SpongeBob: Thanks, mister.
Bus Driver: Yeah, whatev- [SpongeBob turns around and balloon smacks him in the back of the head. Bus driver gets very angry by this point.]
Patrick: Show me what you got at Glove World!
SpongeBob: Okay! Here's my glove light. [turns on light]
Patrick: Wow...
SpongeBob: [puts light inside his head] I see you! [both laugh]
Patrick: I got gloves for my glove action-figure! [puts a tiny glove on the big glove's thumb]
SpongeBob: Cool! [Patrick looks out the window and notices a sign that says "You Are Now Leaving Bikini Bottom" as they drive past it]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [a tiny glove is on his nose] Yeah, Patrick?
Patrick: Where's 'Leaving Bikini Bottom'?
SpongeBob: Where did you see that?
Patrick: We just passed the sign. 'You are now in leaving Bikini Bottom'.
SpongeBob: [gasps] What? [looks out the window]
Patrick: What's wrong, SpongeBob? [driving past a sign that says "Bikini Bottom City Limits"]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think we're on the wrong... [Screams as bus drives down at a 90-degree angle road. SpongeBob and Patrick fly back and his the back of the bus] ...buuuuuuuuuuus!.... ...bus! [SpongeBob walks slowly up front. His face gets all distorted as he is moving closer. His pants rip off and fly at Patrick, but Patrick ducks in time. Then SpongeBob's briefs hits Patrick in the face. Bus comes to an immediate stop and both fly forward and hit the windshield. Then the balloon smacks the bus driver onto the windshield and all of them peel off. SpongeBob and Patrick are kicked off the bus] But, sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom.
Bus Driver: [hands balloon to SpongeBob] Oh, well. [drives bus away]
Patrick: What is this, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [reads sign] Rock Bottom. [scroll over to a bus station] It sure is weird around here. Kinda different, even the soil looks different. [picks up some green soil]
Green Soil: Do you... [raspberry] mind... [raspberry] putting me down? [SpongeBob shakes him off as he gasps]
Patrick: Bob, I don't like it here. It's dark and scary. I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. Look, I can't even tell the bathrooms apart. [bathroom doors have the "?" on one door and the "¿" on the other]
SpongeBob: Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick. We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know. [someone comes out the "¿" door. Patrick gasps] Maybe we should wait for one more. [a snake-like creature comes out of the "?" door. 3 creatures come out the "¿" door]
Patrick: I still can't read the signs. I wanna go home.
SpongeBob: Uhh, uhh, okay. You wait for the bus. Call me when it comes and I'm gonna get a bus schedule. [walks off] Boy, this place sure is creepy. [bus drives by with Patrick's head sticking out the window]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, the bus is here. [SpongeBob runs after the bus] SpongeBob...! [bus drives up the 90-degree angle road and SpongeBob tries to run up the road but falls down. Tries a couple more times but is unsuccessful]
SpongeBob: I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right. Don't run for a bus. [puts on Grandpa disguise] Especially one that's going up at a 90-degree angle. [takes off disguise] I better go wait for the next one. [later, SpongeBob is standing by the bus stop sign with his glove balloon in his right hand] C'mon, bus. I've got to get home and feed Gary. [notices shoe untied and lets go of the balloon] Uh-oh, shoe's untied. [Puts foot on bus sign] Over, under, and over, and loop-dee-loop, and over... [bus drives up and then drives off] and through the hole. [later, wind is blowing SpongeBob's glove hat on his side so he puts it back. Wind blows balloon away] My balloon! [chases after balloon jumping for it when he gets the chance. A bus drives up and then drives off] Wait! Hold on! Stop that bus! Aww, not again! [throws hat down. Notices a creature with a red light on his head for an antenna] Umm, excuse me, sir. Can you help me? [the creature gives raspberry] Uhh, uhh, yeah, I... [creature runs after balloon] No, no! Not the balloon! I need to know when the next bus comes... [bus drives up and then drives off. SpongeBob runs after it, but decides to walk back to the bus stop sign] Well, there goes another one. I gotta be more diligent. I am not leaving this spot, no matter what. [SpongeBob's stomach growls] I'm gettin' hungry. [snaps fingers] Glove candy dispenser. Good thing I went to Glove World!. [squeezes out 6 tiny glove candies onto his tongue, then spits them out] Eww, glove flavored! Hey, what's that? [a kandy machine is shown across the road] A candy machine. Mmm, kelp nougat crunch. Mmm... [Checks each side of the road to see if a bus is coming] I'm not leaving this spot, no matter what! [stomach growls] I'll only be gone a second. [runs over to the machine. While getting out a quarter, a bus drives up. Runs back across to bus] Hey! [bus drives off] Ooh! [stomach growls. Takes a few steps across the road and turns around to check for the bus. Takes a few more steps and checks again. Gets to the candy machine and takes out the quarter. Before inserting it, he checks for a bus. There's no bus so he puts in the quarter but a bus DOES come and drives off. Now he checks to his left down the road and decides to sprint across and get some candy. Pushes some buttons and checks for the bus. The candy is slowly coming down] Come on, come on! [candy drops to the bottom. SpongeBob grabs for it, but a bus drives up and then drives off. SpongeBob gets angry. He reaches for the candy but a bus comes up. Every time he reaches for the candy, the bus drives forward but when he pulls his arm away, the bus drives backwards. So he decides to leave the candy and run after the bus, but the bus drives off before he can get there. A creature comes up and takes the candy] Hey, that was mine! [walks over to the candy machine. 3 buses drives up and drive off while he's over there so he decides to run back. No more buses come, so he shakes the bus sign angrily] Barnacles! Alright, that's it. No more mister nice guy. [later, SpongeBob is at the candy machine staring at it and a bus drives up. Another SpongeBob tip-toes up, but the SpongeBob at the candy machine falls over revealing it to be made of wood. The bus drives off] Tartar sauce! [SpongeBob is now a bench. A bus drives up, but drives off after it notices the SpongeBob bench] Fish paste! [walking into the bus station] I'm getting to the bottom of this, right now! I want a bus to Bikini Bottom. I am first in line and no one is going to tell me, otherwise! [sees a giant green round creature standing behind him already in line] Okay, second. I am second in line. [sees another giant creature already in line] Okay, third is good. [another creature is already in line] Fourth, not bad. [Cut to SpongeBob at the end of the line behind a yellow creature] Okay, 329. I am 329th in line and nobody forget it. [yellow creature spits out a giant egg on SpongeBob's head with the number 329 on it]
Window Attendant: Next. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: Well, at least the line is moving. [everyone steps forward. Egg hatches 3 baby yellow creatures that jump in front of SpongeBob, thus making him now 331st in line. SpongeBob gets extremely angry. He lets out an angry grunt.] Tartar sauce! [SpongeBob hides inside his clothes and goes ballistic. Then comes out and everyone staring at him turns around]
Window Attendant: [time is going fast. raspberry] Next. [raspberry] Next. [raspberry] Next. [raspberry] Next. Next...
SpongeBob: Finally! Yes, I'm next! [runs up to the window] When is the next bus to Bikini Bottom?
Window Attendant: What? [raspberry]
SpongeBob: The bus schedule. The next bus.
Window Attendant: I can't... [raspberry] understand... [raspberry] your accent. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: The next bus... [raspberry] to Bikini... [raspberry] Bottom. [long raspberry]
Window Attendant: Ohh. [raspberry] Why didn't you say so? [raspberry] Next bus leaves in... [raspberry] 5 seconds. [bus leaves] Ohh, tough luck, kid. [raspberry] That's the last one til' morning. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: Oh, [raspberry] no... [raspberry] you don't! [raspberry]
Window Attendant: Goodnight! [puts closed sign up]
SpongeBob: Hold it, I'm not through here! [raspberry] Do you hear me? [raspberry] I demand you come back and give me a bus to Bikini Bottom, right now. And until then, I am not leaving this spot! [gives 3 raspberries. Lights turn off. SpongeBob laughs nervously] Okay, like I said, I'll be right here when you get back. At this spot. In the dark. By myself. With no one around. Except my glove light! [turns on light] Ah, that's better.
[The glove light stops working; short pause.]
SpongeBob: This isn't your average everyday darkness. This is... advanced darkness. Hey... [closes eyes] if I close my eyes, it doesn't seem so dark.
[A raspberry is heard in the distance; he opens his eyes]
SpongeBob: Who's there? [walks down the road] Well, I guess that spot will be there tomorrow. I better just keep walking. [hears another raspberry] Running! Better start running! Running! [hears another raspberry] Sprinting! I just gotta keep sprinting! [runs into the 90-degree angle road. Sits down with scallops flying around his head] Sitting, sitting. Bleeding. [hears noise] Hey, who's there? [hears another raspberry] Okay, that's enough. [hears another raspberry] Don't come closer. [hears another raspberry] I'm warning you! [hears another raspberry] I'm a sponge! [a red light shines around SpongeBob. It's the friendly creature from before that chased after the balloon] Oh, it's only you. [the creature ties balloon to SpongeBob's wrist] Well, that solves my balloon problem, but I have a bigger problem. [the creature begins blowing balloon bigger] I'm kinda stuck here. I need to catch a bus to get home. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Balloon... [raspberry] has... [raspberry] enough... [raspberry] air... [raspberry] thanks. [gives a few more raspberries as he is floating up] Hey, I get it, balloon travel. Thank... [raspberry] you! [raspberry]
Creature: You're welcome!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob, with the balloon still tied to his wrist, floats all the way back home] Ah, home at last. [balloon pops]
Patrick: [riding another bus to Rock Bottom] Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm coming back for ya!
Narrator: Fishermen have quite an effect on our undersea friends. [shows fishermen in boats fishing near the Bikini Bottom atoll]
Squidward: SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?
SpongeBob: Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table nine. [uses himself as a cleaning tool]
Mr. Krabs: They're back! They're back I tell ya! I saw it with me own eyes! [everyone looks at Mr. Krabs like he's crazy] The hooks! The hooks!
Fred: How about a mint?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks! The hooks!
Tom: Can you make that to go?
Squidward: [gives Tom his food in a bag] You don't know how lucky you are.
Mr. Krabs: The hooks. So there I was, minding my own business...
Squidward: I'd love to hear another of your riveting sea tales, but, um... I have to do my waste basket inspection. [puts a trashcan on his head] Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. There's one.
Mr. Krabs: Fine. Don't say I didn't warn ya.
SpongeBob: Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks, me bucko. They're back. Beware the hooks.
SpongeBob: The hooks?
Mr. Krabs: Aye. [shapes his arm like a hook as SpongeBob looks at his arm] The hooks. [The camera shows SpongeBob's face with a reflection with Mr. Krabs' arm as a hook] They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey, they grab you by the britches... [grabs Scooter's pants and lifts high like he is giving him a wedgie. His drink decreases every time Mr. Krabs grabs his pants as he sips it] ...and haul you way up high. Then higher, and higher, and higher [he opens a hatch on the roof and points at the surface] until you're hauled up to the surface, flopping and gasping for breath. And then, they cook ya, and then, they eat ya, or worse...
SpongeBob: [gasps] What could be worse than that?
Mr. Krabs: Gift shops. [shows gift shop and the inside of the gift shop]
SpongeBob: [gasps and hides under a box] Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: There, there, boy. They won't get ya. Not as long as you listen to ol' Mr. Krabs. Now get back to the kitchen. Time is money.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. [goes in the kitchen with the box on him]
Patrick: [pokes his head through one of the kitchen windows] Good morning, Krusty Krew.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Guess what? The carnival's in town. Come on, let's go.
SpongeBob: I can't leave now. I'm working.
Patrick: It's not leaving. You're just taking a break. [SpongeBob goes outside behind unseen] We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carni... [trips and falls on face] We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town. [many hooks are dangling] I'm gonna be first in line for everything!
SpongeBob: Where is everybody?
Patrick: I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier. [a pair of kids' sneakers lie on the ground nearby]
SpongeBob: Doesn't look like any carnival I ever... [bumps into a hook] Excuse me. [gasps as he sees the hook as the camera shows SpongeBob's face again with the reflection with a hook] Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous!
Patrick: [sits on a hook] Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese!
SpongeBob: All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!
[Patrick is putting the cheese in his mouth]
Patrick: Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it. [the hook where Patrick ate the cheese from is pulled up]
SpongeBob: [faces another hook with cheese attached to it] But, Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: SpongeBob, let me ask you something. [the hook that SpongeBob is facing is pulled up. Patrick is shown with 9 hooks in his mouth and still has 1 in his hand] Does this look dangerous?
SpongeBob: [screams] Patrick, don't!
Patrick: Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel... [hooks pulls him up]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back. Oh, my best friend. [Patrick floats down and SpongeBob runs into him as he hits the ground] Patrick, you're alive.
Patrick: Am I ever. You should try it.
SpongeBob: But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops?
Patrick: You just jump off before you go up too high.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.
Patrick: Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey? [he jumps on a fish-like attachment on the hook]
SpongeBob: Well, no.
Patrick: Wheeee.
SpongeBob: I guess he didn't. [he jumps on the attachment with Patrick]
Patrick: Hi Ho, Silverfish. Away! [The hook pulls them up. We see a fisherman reeling in his fishing rod. We see SpongeBob and Patrick laughing out of enjoyment. The camera alternates between the fisherman to SpongeBob and Patrick. After a few cuts, SpongeBob and Patrick are about to jump off]
SpongeBob: Ready?
Patrick: Ready.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Geronimo! [jump off]
SpongeBob: This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab. [We cut to the exterior at the Krusty Krab when customers are muttering angrily. We cut to see Ivy mad with Harold]
Ivy: P.U., [points at his Krabby Patty] you call this food?!
Harold: My sandwich tastes like a fried boot!
Another Harold: [Starts holding up his fried boot] My sandwich is a fried boot!
Fred: Hurry it up, will ya? We're hungry over here. Look at us. My kids haven't eaten in three days and I'm dying. That's not how you're supposed to flip it. [customers muttering angrily... all talking at once; Squidward frantically flipping burnt patties]
Squidward: [defensive] Why do you wanna eat this stuff anyway?!
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?
Squidward: It's a feeding frenzy, sir. And SpongeBob's not back from his break. [Mr. Krabs laughs] What?
Mr. Krabs: I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taken a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59. [laughs] Now, what were you saying?
Squidward: He took a break.
Mr. Krabs: [stares in shocked silence, as his arms and nose fall off. He then storms out the front door] Alright, SpongeBob LazyPants, I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues. [uses his nose to smell] Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget.
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs, I still need help! [all the customers pick up Squidward like they are a mob]
Mr. Krabs: [uses his nose to smell again] They should be right here. [SpongeBob & Patrick float down as they are laughing]
Patrick: Again?
SpongeBob: Again!
Mr. Krabs: The hooks! No! No! No!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [pulling on hook] 1, 2, 3...
Mr. Krabs : Wait! Wait!
SpongeBob and Patrick: ...blastoff. [hook pulls them up as Mr. Krabs slams into a rock]
Mr. Krabs: Boys. I wasn't quick enough. They're gone! [sobs] If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd... [SpongeBob and Patrick float back down while laughing] ...I'd throttle 'em! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!
SpongeBob: I...I...I...
Patrick: I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride em up, and up, and up, then you gently flow down.
Mr. Krabs: And do you know what happens when you don't float back down?
SpongeBob: Gift shop?
Mr. Krabs: Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna. [shows a can of tuna] With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise! [shows a jar of mayo while a female screams in the background]
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.
SpongeBob & Patrick: [raises hands] We promise, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I need a sailors promise. Repeat after me: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks I'll never go.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks we'll never go.
[a hook pokes Mr. Krabs in the butt]
Mr. Krabs: [leaps up, holding his injured rear] Yow! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ahh! Mother of pearl. Fire on the poop deck. [they turn and rub their own behinds]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa. Whew. Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap. [Cuts to the exterior of SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm ready! [comes running out of the house] I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, ready, ready. I'm ready. [Patrick comes out from his rock]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way. [crashes into his furniture]
SpongeBob: I always go to work this way.
Patrick: You're not going to work today. We're going to go play hooky!
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, we promised.
Patrick: Well, I had my fingers crossed.
SpongeBob: You don't have any fingers, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us.
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?
SpongeBob: Umm...
Patrick: See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm gonna go have some fun. [Patrick goes up and down the hooks] Come on, SpongeBob. You know you want to!
SpongeBob: Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another... [almost runs into a hook. Gasps] ...hook! [almost touches the hook but takes it back] Oh no! Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar! A deceiver! I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never! [goes back to hook] Is this seat taken? [hook takes him up, but when he comes down and turns around, it is shown that he is hooked at the pants] Whew! Glad I got that out of my system. [gasps] I'm...hooked! And that means... [shows the tuna can with SpongeBob crammed inside] Help! I'm hooked! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!
Mr. Krabs: Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends.
Pearl: Thanks, dad.
Mr. Krabs: Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol' Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Psst, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, laddie?
SpongeBob: Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?
Mr. Krabs: Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?
SpongeBob: Umm...no. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes, yes, you told me not to go near them.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you, laddie?
SpongeBob: Of course not. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean, not exactly. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes! Yes I did it! I admit it! [cries] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me! I'm hooked! [shows the hook to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.
SpongeBob: What am I gonna do?
Mr. Krabs: There's only one thing to do, boy. [group of girls laugh. SpongeBob looks at his pants]
SpongeBob: Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls. [hook pulls him closer] D’oh, okay. I'm taking em off. I'm taking 'em off. [takes pants off] There.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... lad?
SpongeBob: [screams] Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs. I can't do it! Anything but that!
Mr. Krabs: I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob. [he places a "Help Wanted" sign on the door] But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: [hook pulls him a little closer] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise. [He holds on to a flower but the hook pulls him away. He holds on to the Krusty Krab signpost] Please save me, Mr. Krabs! [cries] I promise I'll be good! [underwear tears off] Whew. [the signpost flings him into the door naked, which makes the girls laugh]
Girls: Ooh, look! [laughs]
Pearl: It's SpongeBob NudeyPants! [SpongeBob screams and runs]
Squidward: [holding a fishing hook with SpongeBob's underwear on the hook] Well, that was more of SpongeBob than I needed to see.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, that was some fine angling. Do you think the lad has learned his lesson?
Squidward: Oh, I think he'll remember this for a long time. I know I will. [both laugh. Shows SpongeBob running back to his house]
SpongeBob: The pants! The underwear! [cries]
Patrick: [bus drops off a can of tuna] Hello? Does somebody have a can opener?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob walks outside his house, and breathes in the fresh air] Ahh, what a wonderful day. The sun is out, the water is shimmering, scallops are chirping. So peaceful. [SpongeBob immediately grabs wood, a hammer, and some nails, and starts to noisily build a stand. Squidward peeks his head out the window]
Squidward: Can we lower the volume, please? I can't work with all that racket going on!
SpongeBob: Oh, sure thing, Squidward.
Squidward: Yes. Mmm. Right. Mmm.
SpongeBob: Okay. [he taps on a nail lightly, and he looks up at Squidward's window. He does it again, and continues to, making sure he doesn't make too much noise. Meanwhile, in Squidward's house, Squidward has his clarinet in hand]
Squidward: And now... for some soothing sounds from Squidward's clarinet. Thank you, thank you. [He starts to play. SpongeBob looks up and sees that Squidward is playing, so he decides to finish his stand quickly. Squidward looks out the window again.]
Squidward: I thought I... Wha?
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Wanna blow some bubbles? Only 25 cents.
Squidward: Oh, right. Like I would spend a moment of my time blowing bubbles.
SpongeBob: Uh huh.
Squidward: Oh, puh-lease. I mean, who in the world would pay to blow bubbles? [Patrick comes out of his house, stuck to the underside of the rock]
Patrick: Good morning. [he falls and screams]
Squidward: Oh, boy. [Patrick walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Good morning to you, sir. Would you care to blow a bubble?
Patrick: Hmm, how much is it?
SpongeBob: Only a quarter.
Patrick: Sounds reasonable. [whispering] Uh, I'm going to need to borrow a quarter.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Patrick. [he pulls out a quarter and he gives it to Patrick]
Patrick: Ah, one quarter. [he hands the quarter back to SpongeBob, and bites it to see if it's real]
SpongeBob: Thank you. [cuts back to Squidward]
Squidward: Hmm, business is booming. [he laughs] How did I ever get surrounded by such loser neighbors? Uh huh. [he continues playing. Cut back to SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob dips the wand in the bubble soap]
SpongeBob: One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go. [Patrick grabs the wand from SpongeBob, inhales deeply and begins to blow, but a bubble doesn't come out. He pants and blows again. After a while, SpongeBob puts up a "Lessons" sign. Patrick then loses his breath] Could I interest you in some lessons? Only 25 cents.
Patrick: Uh, very well, then. Hey, Sponge, can I borrow another quarter? [SpongeBob hands Patrick a quarter] Thanks. [he winks and hands the quarter back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, it's all in the technique. [he starts doing his infamous routine] First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then... [he blows bubbles shaped like ducks]
Patrick: Oooh. [SpongeBob pops out of nowhere and blows a box. Patrick giggles and SpongeBob blows a caterpillar] Ah! [The caterpillar then pops one-by-one, with descending sounds. Patrick continues to giggle. SpongeBob blows a boat, and it floats off, pops, and makes a foghorn noise. Cuts to inside of Squidward's house]
Squidward: Huh? [he shakes his clarinet. Cut back to outside with SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: And now... with two hands! [he inhales deeply and blows out an elephant. Circus music, in particular part of the piece "Entry of the Gladiators", starts playing.]
Patrick: [Laughs] It's a giraffe! [Patrick continues laughing as the elephant floats over into Squidward's house. SpongeBob then frowns as the bubble pops and tons of smaller bubbles come out of both windows of the house while an elephant sounds. Squidward opens the door with a sour look on his face. SpongeBob and Patrick hide behind the stand. SpongeBob places a "Closed" sign on it. Squidward looks over the stand]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, sir, but we are clo-
Squidward: Don't give me any of that! How can you two possibly make all this noise just blowing bubbles?!
SpongeBob: We're not just blowing bubbles. We're making bubble art. Watch carefully. [he does his infamous routine again] First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then... [he blows a butterfly, which flies over to Squidward, lands on his head, and pops]
Squidward: That's not art. That's just annoying. Blowing bubbles, that's the lamest idea I have ever heard. [SpongeBob and Patrick, now depressed, head to SpongeBob's house] You should be ashamed of yourselves. [SpongeBob closes the door as Squidward laughs to himself] Bubbles. [he continues laughing] Art. [he mumbles, and picks up the bubble wand, sniffs it, and inhales to blow. Then, SpongeBob pops up out of nowhere]
SpongeBob: That'll be 25 cents, sir.
Squidward: Ah, whoa, what? [SpongeBob blinks] Oh... who-who would pay 25 cents to blow bubbles?
SpongeBob: We also offer lessons for beginners. [he puts the "Lessons" sign up]
Squidward: Beginners? What could be more simple than blowing a stupid bubble? [he pulls a quarter out] Here's your 25 cents! [SpongeBob bites it to see if it's real and it bends] Watch and learn. [he inhales and blows, but nothing happens] Uhh... wait, wait, wait. [he inhales and blows again, but nothing happens again] One more time. Here. Wait. [he inhales and blows again, and a small bubble comes out and instantly falls to the ground and bursts, making a raspberry sound. Looks over at SpongeBob and Patrick. They gulp, and then start whistling. Squidward places another quarter on the stand] Uhh... Just a mere warm-up. [he dips the wand in the bubble container, inhales deeply and blows hard. The bubble falls to the ground again, making another raspberry sound, gets another quarter out and puts it on the stand]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, remember the technique. [Squidward keeps trying to blow bubbles while SpongeBob and Patrick are trying to show him the technique] Squidward, technique! You do this, and this, step back....
Patrick: Hey! Technique, Squidward!
SpongeBob: Spin around like thi— Like this... Look at me, over here, one... two.... yeah, three...
Patrick: The pelvic woo!
SpongeBob: Look, we're doing the technique! And don't for... Don't forget the "Woooooo!" Squidward?
Patrick: Listen to Sponge!
SpongeBob: Technique! Technique! Technique!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [while standing on one foot] Technique! Technique! Technique! Technique! Tech- [Squidward looks at them]
SpongeBob: [weakly] You're not doing the technique.
Patrick: Technique.
Squidward: Technique? Technique!? Technique, technique, technique, technique, technique! [he starts to do the infamous routine, while imitating SpongeBob] First I do this, spin around. Stop. Double take three times. And here we go, pelvic thrust. Wehooooo! Wehoohoo! Oh, stop on your right foot, don't forget it. Then, bring it around town. And a little of this, a little of that, a little of this, this, this, this, that, that, that, that. And that, that, that that that that! And then... [Screams into the wand, blowing a gargantuan, unshaped bubble]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow! [Squidward is then lifted off the ground. The bubble pops off the wand and Squidward falls back on the ground]
SpongeBob: All right, Squid. That was so good.
Patrick: Squid is number one.
Squidward: I really did it, didn't I? Hey, you guys didn't blow anything like that.
SpongeBob: No.
Squidward: Now that's a bubble.
SpongeBob: You said it, Squidward. See, it is all in the technique.
Patrick: Yeah, technique.
Squidward: Technique? Hah. SpongeBob, you don't think I created that [kisses his tentacle] beautiful work of art with your help? [he starts laughing] Come on, it's in my genes.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squid's got genes! Squid's got genes! [Squidward walks back to his house]
Squidward: Thank you, thank you, thank you. [he starts to play his clarinet. SpongeBob and Patrick chant Squidward's name. At one point, they belly flop each other and Patrick falls on the ground.] I rock. [Squidward continues to play his clarinet. As SpongeBob and Patrick continue to chant, Squidward's bubble flies over them, covers Squidward's house, and pulls it out of the ground and up towards the top of the ocean. SpongeBob notices and stops Patrick]
SpongeBob: [concerned] Squidward! [Patrick now notices]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! [Squidward stops playing his clarinet]
Squidward: Hello, my friends. You are looking at a... [he sees how far he is from the surface]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
Squidward: ...genius. [the bubble explodes in the air and then the ground violently rumbles and shakes. SpongeBob and Patrick look in awe]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow! [the ground stops shaking. The two slowly walk back to their homes. They then speed up and run inside their houses. Squidward's house floats back to the surface. He starts playing his clarinet weakly as the screen fades to black, ending the episode]
[Squidward is sleeping and hears noises. He awakens, revealing SpongeBob and Patrick under his blanket with a sign that reads "happy birthday"]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Surprise! Happy birthday, Squidward! [all three standing in front of a cake] Happy happy birthday! Happy birthday cake! [standing in front of a picture of a seahorse and Squidward has the tail] Happy happy birthday! Pin the tail on the seahorse! [surrounded by presents] Happy happy birthday! Happy birthday, Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick run out of Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Yeah! So long, Squidward, bye-bye, don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Patrick: Another year older. [laughs]
Squidward: It's not my birthday! [shuts door and takes off party hat] That's it! I'm moving out of this neighborhood!
Realtor Lady: [looking at a picture of Squidward's house] Absolutely, Mr. Tentacles! [showing the Realtor lady as Patty Rechid from Bikini Realty on phone] I can sell your home in a heartbeat.
Squidward: Oh, that's great news, because I want to move as soon as possible.
Patty: No problem! As long as it's not infested with nematodes, or surrounded by troublesome neighbors or something like that.
Squidward: Oh sure, there's none of that... Did you say "neighbors?"
Patty: Of course! I can't tell you how many times I've seen a sale fall through because of bad neighbors.
Squidward: Neighbors. Uhh...
Patty: Anyway, I'll be by tomorrow to check out the house. See you then! [both hang up]
Squidward: SpongeBob! No one will ever buy my house with him living next door! Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite! Opposite... opposite... [Later, SpongeBob is sleeping, but is awaken from Squidward's instrument playing outside]
SpongeBob: Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum? [Squidward stops playing]
Squidward: Drum? What drum? [puts the drum on the ground and punches a hole in it] This is just my wig case! See? [puts on the wig, kicks the drum out of the way and frolics around] Come on, SpongeBob, tackle me!
SpongeBob: Squidward! You need bed rest! [pushes Squidward to his house as Squidward is blowing bubbles] I'll keep you safe until you're well again.
Squidward: Oh, I get it. You don't know what day it is, do you?
SpongeBob: Uhh, Wednesday?
Squidward: Why, it's Opposite Day! [SpongeBob is confused] You mean you've never heard of it? Boy, have you been missing out! Opposite Day is the one day of the year when you get to act different! Normally I'm stuffy, boring, but today I'm silly and spontaneous!
SpongeBob: Does everybody know about Opposite Day?
Squidward: Oh sure! It's a game! Get it?
SpongeBob: Oh, a game.
Squidward: Yeah! Normally, you're really loud and annoying, so what are you going to be today?
SpongeBob: Quiet and out of the way! Yay!
Squidward: Yeah! Why don't you get a jump on it.
SpongeBob: I love... I mean, I hate Opposite Day. [giggles as he runs back into his pineapple] I'm not ready!
Squidward: So long, chum. [takes off wig] And goodbye, Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: [running to Gary] Gary! It's Opposite Day and I... [stops running] ...walk, don't run. And I'm gonna... opposite... opposite... I'm just gonna crawl into bed and do nothing all day. [crawls into bed] Too bad it only comes once a year, huh, Gary?
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: Gary, where’s your holiday spirit?
Gary: [barks like a dog]
SpongeBob: [doorbell rings] Company! I hate company. Who's there?
Patrick: It's Patrick!
SpongeBob: Patrick... go away! I never want to see you again! [giggles, but Patrick cries]
Patrick: [sobbing] SpongeBob doesn't like me anymore!
SpongeBob: [opens door] That's right! You're my worst enemy! [Patrick falls to the ground, bawling] Patrick, you're not really not my friend. It's just Opposite Day!
Patrick: Opposite Day? Hey, I've heard of that!
SpongeBob: You have?
Patrick: No! What is it?
SpongeBob: Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite.
Patrick: Oh! Let me try! Let me try! [Patrick holds his breath and turns purple]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick, breathe! [He takes a deep breath in and pants] Not that opposite. Let me show you how to do it the wrong way!
[SpongeBob and Patrick dance across the screen as SpongeBob is pink and Patrick is yellow. Gary eats properly from a table]
SpongeBob: [eats from Gary's bowl] Meow.
Patrick: [sitting on newspapers] Meow.
[SpongeBob and Patrick both blow a bubble, but they blow themselves into bubbles, instead. Patrick pops]
SpongeBob: Kcirtap yeh. [forwards: Hey Patrick.]
Patrick: Pu evig i. [forwards: I give up.]
SpongeBob: Edis etisoppo eht ot teg ot! [forwards: To get to the opposite side.]
[Both laugh in reverse. Cut back to house]
SpongeBob: Say, want to help me do some work around the house, worst enemy?
Patrick: Nope. [He smiles, both laugh]
Squidward: Nearly noon and not a peep from SpongeBob! [packing his belongings into boxes] I'm almost sorry I'm leaving! [laughs] Opposite Day. [hears noises from outside] SpongeBob, what are you... [screams as he sees both SpongeBob and Patrick destroying SpongeBob's pineapple]
SpongeBob: Hello, Squidward! Oops. I mean, goodbye, Squidward! Aww, isn't Opposite Day... [giggles] ...terrible? [laughs]
Squidward: I'll tell you what's terrible! Living next to you! You're the worst neighbor in history!
SpongeBob: Wow! That's the nicest thing Squidward has ever said to me! [Squidward facepalms]
Squidward: [panicked] If the real estate agent sees that mess, I'll never sell this house! [SpongeBob and Patrick look at the destroyed pineapple]
Patrick: Isn't it beautiful?
SpongeBob: On Opposite Day it is. [Squidward drives up with a bulldozer]
Squidward: Out of the way, SpongeBob! [Squidward begins to rebuild the pineapple]
SpongeBob: I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard, [he wraps his arms around himself repeatedly] but that really means he's messing it up. [Patrick is drooling] But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means, [Gary meows] Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob! [SpongeBob wrapped his arms around himself] A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being... [stretches his nose out and puts his belt around the middle of his head to resemble Squidward's head and talks like Squidward] Squidward!
Patrick: Hey! I wanna be opposite, too! [SpongeBob thinks, then snaps his fingers. He takes a piece of coral and puts it below Patrick's eyes where his nose would be] Yeah! Finally! Yoo-hoo! [dances] I'm Squidward, I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Wait! It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite... [talking like Squidward] ...you have to act like him, too. Boy, oh boy, do I like playing the clarinet. I practice and practice all day long, but I never get any better. [normal voice again] Now you try.
Patrick: Okay. [takes a deep breath and continues dancing] I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward. [SpongeBob dances along with Patrick]
SpongeBob and Patrick: I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
SpongeBob: [opens door for Patrick] After you, Mr. Squidward.
Patrick: Why, thank you, Mr. Squidward. [walks in]
SpongeBob: You're quite welcome, Mr. Squidward. [walks in and shuts the door]
Squidward: [still rebuilding SpongeBob's pineapple] Oh, Opposite Day. Next time, it's going to be "Go Jump Off A Cliff Day!" [as he is building, Patty Rechid drives up]
Patty: Oh my! The house is even more beautiful in person! [walks up to the front door, knocks on the door. SpongeBob opens it] Hello, Mr... [looks down] Uh... Mr. Tentacles?
SpongeBob: [talking like Squidward] Yes, please come in.
Patty: It's funny, I pictured you being much taller.
SpongeBob: Yeah, everyone says that.
Patty: Now if you want the sale to go through, you've got to tell me all the positive things about your house.
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Positive things! Opposite Day... [talking like Squidward] I'd love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft.
Patty: Uhh... well, you didn't mention that on the phone.
SpongeBob: Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard! [Patty looks at him, shocked] Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?
Patty: Well, umm, I'm not sure if I'm interested...
SpongeBob: Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer. [laughs then stops] Please follow me. [both walk into Squidward's art room] And here's the worst room in the house. My gallery.
Patty: [looks at painting of Squidward] Oh my, this painting is very nice. [Patrick bursts through the painting]
Patrick: Thank you! [Patty screams and leaps up to the ceiling, hanging onto a beam]
Patty: Who's that?!
SpongeBob: I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward.
Patty: You're both Squidward?
SpongeBob: I'm Squidward, he's Squidward.
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're both Squidward.
Squidward: Well, that's done. At least SpongeBob has been quiet. [sees Patty's boat and screams] NO! [SpongeBob plays Squidward's clarinet badly for Patty]
Patty: Okay, I really don't want to hear another one.
SpongeBob: Okay. [plays more]
Patty: I really don't want to hear more, thank you.
SpongeBob: I hear you loud and clear. [plays more]
Squidward: [bursts in] Stop! Get away from her! Oh, oh, I am so sorry, ma'am, I hope these two [turns to them] barnacle heads [turns back to Patty] haven't harmed you in any way.
Patty: Who are you?
Squidward: Why, I'm Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick pop up in the background. Patty's face slowly turns annoyed]
Patty: [stands up from chair] What kind of fool do you take me for?! [to Patrick] He's Squidward, [to SpongeBob] he's Squidward, [to the real Squidward] you're Squidward?! I'm Squidward!! Are there any other Squidwards I should know about?!!
Gary: [with a pickle on his face. Imitates Squidward's voice] Meow.
Patty: [shocked then angry] I'm outta here. [she walks away]
Squidward: Ma'am, please! What about my house?!
Patty: I wouldn't sell a house for you if you were the last Squidward on earth!!! [walks out of the house]
Squidward: Wait!
SpongeBob: Don't...
Patrick: ...Go!
Squidward: [screams, runs out, and holds onto her leg, dragging him, as she is leaving] No, no, no, no, no!
Patty: Stop! Stop!
Squidward: Please, sell my house!
Patty: Never!!! [releases her leg, gets in her boat]
Squidward: Don't leave me here! [falls to the ground, crying. Patty drives off]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [happily walk up to Squidward] Happy Opposite Day, Squidward! We hate you! [Squidward seethes with fury, then gets an idea]
Squidward: Let me show you guys how much I... hate you! [Squidward drives up with the bulldozer chasing SpongeBob and Patrick, they both scream and run away]
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that Squidward likes us too much?
Squidward: [angry, still chasing them] Happy Opposite Day! [chases them down the street and laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: It's time to grow myself large and wide.
[He grows himself large and wide as he is saying it. Walks over to his weight, which is a pink bunny and a blue bear and has trouble lifting it, but manages to get it over his head anyway. The doorbell rings and SpongeBob opens door]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob. How's it goin'?
SpongeBob: Not too close, Sandy. I tend to get smelly when I'm pumping iron. Check it out. [shows off his muscles, but is still a weakling]
Sandy: Well, you're smelly.
SpongeBob: All thanks to my state-of-the-art work set. [shows all sorts of stuffed animals]
Sandy: Uhh... I don't wanna disappoint you, SpongeBob, but you won't see any progress with those.
SpongeBob: Oh, really?
Sandy: That is, if you want arms like these. [rolls up right sleeve, and flexes her right arm, showing off a big, impressive bicep] Or these! [rolls up other sleeve and flexes left arm, revealing her other bicep] Or these! [shows off her powerful back muscles while executing a back double bicep flex. SpongeBob's arm wiggles in the air]
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, maybe I could use a little help.
Sandy: Well, if you want arms like mine, you just gotta follow my training program.
SpongeBob: Wow, really? That'd be great, Sandy! I can see me now. [imagines himself with muscles and very tall working at the Krusty Krab, singing and jellyfishing at Jellyfish Fields & telling Gary goodnight, too big for his bed] Yeah... that would change everything!
Sandy: Be at my place at 5 a.m. Oh! And you'll need a water helmet. [puts a fish bowl on his head. Now the scene cuts to Sandy's tree dome, where SpongeBob is trying to do push-ups] Come on, SpongeBob, it's only push-ups! Come on. Come on! You can do it! [SpongeBob is grunting at this point determined to get a push-up. His body cracks and falls down while his arms stay up]
SpongeBob: One. [acorn bell dings]
Sandy: [in boxing ring with gloves on] Alright, put 'em up!
SpongeBob: [struggles getting his gloves up] They're up.
Sandy: Ding ding! [punches SpongeBob out of the ring. Later, Sandy starts up her exercise wheel with SpongeBob on it. SpongeBob pants while the wheel goes faster and makes him trip all over the wheel] Feeling the burn?
SpongeBob: I'm-fee-ling-some-thing! [launches out of the wheel and into the tree dome glass]
Sandy: Well, now that we've got warmed up, it's time for the arm-cruncher.
SpongeBob: Arm-cruncher, great. [looks over and sees two cement blocks slamming into the cement pedestal] This squirrel's trying to kill me!
Sandy: [walks up to the arm-cruncher with phone in hand] This is it.
SpongeBob: Hey, that's great, Sandy. Well, I sure had fun, we'll have to do it again sometime, bye. [hangs up] This working-out thing isn't working out. [arms bulge in and out] Ow. Ow. Ow.
TV: Hey, you! Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy! "Oh, I'm a little peanut worm." Are you too much of a wimp to work out? Are you a weakling built like a sponge? Well, now you too can have muscles.
SpongeBob: Huh?
TV: With Anchor arms! [puts a long pink blow-up item on his arm] They slip on like a glove. Just add air. [puts a plug in the arm's hole and pumps air into it] How big do you want 'em? [pumps air into other arm] Normal? [puts more air into arm] Veiny? And for the ladies... [puts air into arm which makes it grow hair] ...hairy. [SpongeBob whistles as the TV puts up an image of a weak shark] I was a wimp before Anchor arms. Now, I'm a jerk and everybody loves me. So order now, wimp!
SpongeBob: Wow, now that's a good idea!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I wanna be just like him. Yeah, I've gotta get to a phone! [later, a big shadow of SpongeBob is walking down the road past Squidward, who is licking a popsicle] Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: [Tongue stuck to popsicle while looking up.] SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: [Next scene is Mr. Krabs sweeping the outside of the Krusty Krab. He looks up.] Huh?
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Mother of pearl! [hides in the Krusty Krab. Now, at Mussel Beach where everyone is lifting weights. SpongeBob comes in and makes one guy drop a big weight on two others' feet]
Fish: Ow...
SpongeBob: Hi, guys. [shows off new muscles]
Larry: SpongeBob, is that you?
SpongeBob: [walking on his hands] Who were you expecting, Tiny Tim? Wait... wait... [flexes those muscles] They're big, aren't they?
Larry: Dude, you're ripped!
SpongeBob: [flexes out the words] Thank...You. I've been working out. Excuse me a second. [flexes more] Yeah. Anyone up for the... [flexes muscles into drinks] ...juice bar? (bubble transition to juice bar)
Scooter: I'm tellin' ya, he's huge!
Sandy: Have you guys seen SpongeBob anywhere?
Scooter: You mean 'MuscleBob BuffPants'? He's in there! [points to inside of bar]
Sandy: Uhh, whatever. Thanks.
SpongeBob: [now inside]I start off with twenty raw eggs everyday. But that's just me.
Sandy: Pardon me.
SpongeBob: Working out is my life! I remember when I used to look like that guy over there. [points to weak fish]
Fish: Who me? [everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: I remember when I used to look like you, too. [points to Larry and laughs] But, that was a long time ago.
Bartender: Here's your drink, sir.
SpongeBob: Thank you. [tries to lift up drink but can't so he stretches his mouth out to the straw and drinks] Yeah...
Sandy: SpongeBob? Wha-where'd you get those muscles?
SpongeBob: I've created my own workout routine that's given me amazing results. [anchor arm almost slips off] Whoops! Yeah, I have never felt better.
Sandy: Heck, what's your secret?
SpongeBob: What?
Sandy: Your secret workout. What is it? [everyone wants to know and looks over at SpongeBob. SpongeBob thinks of something nervously and quickly.]
SpongeBob: Hmmm, well... I, uhh... first I take my hand and I do this... [makes armpit noises]
Larry: Are you kidding?
SpongeBob: Do these muscles lie? [flexes muscles into a shape of a sponge. Everyone starts making armpit noises]
Sandy: I'm glad to see you found an exercise program that works for you.
SpongeBob: Yeah, your workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me.
Sandy: Can't argue with those results. What you need to do now is put those muscles to the test.
SpongeBob: Uhh, what do you mean?
Sandy: The big Mussel Beach anchor tossing competition. It's today! Everybody'll be there!
Bartender: Here's your drink. [sets drink on SpongeBob's anchor-arm hand and it sinks down]
Sandy: Hey, with those arms, you'll do great!
SpongeBob: Uhh, well, I'm not sure.
Sandy: C'mon, let's go.
SpongeBob: Right now? Wait, uhh, wait, Sandy. I don't think it's such a... [tries to run away but the drink is holding him back. Tries lifting the drink but is unsuccessful] Sandy, wait!
Sandy: Here it is-- the sign-in list.
SpongeBob: Oh, no.
Sandy: [signs her name on a piece of paper] Okay, Sandy Cheeks. [puts the paper into entry box]
SpongeBob: [still struggling] Wait, Sandy-- don't sign just yet!
Sandy: [Puts the paper in the box]
SpongeBob: Wait!
Sandy: Okay...
SpongeBob: [struggles even harder] Wait!
Sandy: [signs names] SpongeBob SquarePants. [the bartender lifts the drink off of SpongeBob, which sends him flying towards Sandy]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait...! [slams into pole]
Sandy: It's okay, SpongeBob, I already signed your name in.
SpongeBob: Oh, great. Thanks, Sandy. [at the competition]
Announcer: We on? Welcome to the Goo Lagoon 8th annual anchor toss competition. [everyone is getting ready but SpongeBob is nervous]
Sandy: Ready, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Great. No problem. [blows frantically into his Anchor Arms]
Announcer: Could I get some mustard on that? Oh. First up, Don the Whale. [Don throws the anchor and it lands. Fish comes up to measure distance]
Measurer: 200 yards. [crowd cheers]
Announcer: Let's see an instant-replay. [another anchor comes flying in on top of the measurer and hits him.] Amazing! Up next, Larry the Lobster. [Larry throws his anchor and it follows the measurer wherever he goes]
Measurer: 210 yards!
Announcer: Here goes, Sandy Cheeks. [Sandy throws it up in the air and kicks it away. Measurer runs around until he gets hit]
Measurer: 510 yards!
Announcer: Wow! Fabulous!
Sandy: Beat that, SpongeBob!
Announcer: Up next, SpongeBob SquarePants.
Crowd: [crowd is imitating the armpit exercise while others are holding up SpongeBob signs and chanting] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [tries to pull the anchor but instead he falls under the ground with the anchor and comes out and laughs] Just kidding. Just kidding. [everyone laughs]
Sandy: That SpongeBob is funnier than ears on an acorn.
SpongeBob: Oh, this is it. They're all gonna find out I'm a fake. I can't give up. I've got to try. I can do it! I've got Anchor Arms! I'm no wimp, I'm a jerk!
[He blows his Anchor Arms over the "JERK" size. Tries to lift the anchor again but when he tries too hard, some of the air in one arm goes into SpongeBob's nose. Tries to lift again, but the air goes into his left eye as the crowd 'ooh's. Tries to lift again and causes the air to go into his left tooth. Tries to lift again the last time, causing the Anchor Arms to burst around his body, then explode. After the air blows off, the popped Anchor Arms deflate, floating down. SpongeBob then reveals his real arms hidden from inside his body.]
Crowd Attendee: I think he lost. [crowd chants for Sandy] Sandy! Sandy! Sandy! [Sandy walks up to SpongeBob and taps her foot, disappointed. SpongeBob walks away, leaving his destroyed Anchor Arms on the ground and follows Sandy to the Treedome]
SpongeBob: 96. 97. 98. 99. 100.
Sandy: I want 100 more.
SpongeBob: It hurts. [changes channel over and over] 1. 2. 3. 4...
Sandy: I think we finally found an exercise for you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: ...9. 10. [his arm falls off] Can you get that?
Narrator: Ahh, lunchtime at the Krusty Krab. Everyone is enjoying their Krabby Patties. [lights go off and sirens and red lights blare as everyone in the Krusty Krab screams and runs for cover] Huh?! What's this? [doors and windows are now metal]
Mr. Krabs: Can you spot him, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: [up in a crows nest with a telescope] Down there, sir! [a Krabby Patty is bouncing to the door]
Narrator: [gasps] There appears to be a Krabby Patty napping in progress! [Krabby Patty shoots a laser hole big enough for it to go through at the door] There can only be one culprit: Plankton!
Plankton: Finally, victory is mine! I win, I win, I win! [laughs]
Squidward: He got away, sir.
Mr. Krabs: [devastated] No! He's finally stolen me secret recipe!
Narrator: Perhaps not, Monsieur Krabs, for it's... [SpongeBob tears himself into another SpongeBob and flies off] ...SpongeBob SquarePants! [later, SpongeBob peeks out through under the sewer with binoculars in his hand. Catches a peek at a Krabby Patty jumping through the crowd]
SpongeBob: A-ha! [chases it behind some buildings] Hey! [Plankton flies up with a propeller. SpongeBob takes the twirling club that the cop is using as a propeller and flies after the Krabby Patty to the top of a building] Okay, that's far enough! Huh? [patty jumps off building] Tartar sauce! [uses his hat as a balloon-like ball and jumps off the building. Bounces off the ground towards the Krabby Patty. Bounces past a cowboy and a cowgirl]
Cowboy: Yeehaw! [Plankton walks into a magic shop and comes back out with funny glasses on]
SpongeBob: Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and... [looks up and reads the sign MAGIC SHOP] Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, "If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true." [Plankton takes away Krabby Patty]
Plankton: Argh! I can't take it!
SpongeBob: Plankton! It's you!
Plankton: Yes! And after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that... that just wasn't fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don't want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don't know what it's like to be a loser. [cries]
SpongeBob: Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.
Plankton: [stops crying] Wh-what did you say?
SpongeBob: I said, you're a-- [a bunch of people run up and point at Plankton]
All: Loser! [Plankton jumps away from group and walks back to his restaurant]
Squidward: How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton?! It hurts, doesn't it?! I know!
Policeman: Yeah, and for running you out, we're going to make this kid honorary town rookie of the day. [puts a big donut with a ribbon on it around SpongeBob]
Squidward, Mr. Krabs, the policeman, Fred, Tammy, Joe, Millie, Ricardo, and Stella:  For he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie... 
[Everyone throws SpongeBob into the air.]
SpongeBob: [thinking to himself] I'll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn't be such a meanie.
All: [as SpongeBob comes down, they stop singing] Which no... whatever. [everyone walks away. Later, Plankton hears a knock on his door at his restaurant]
Plankton: A customer? [opens door] Our special today is chum... [sees SpongeBob at the door] ...balaya.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Plankton.
Plankton: Haven't you degraded me enough for one day?
SpongeBob: No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me.
Plankton: What?
SpongeBob: Play with me.
Plankton: You know how to induce thermonuclear fusion?
SpongeBob: No, but I like to go jelly... [Plankton closes the door]
Plankton: That naïve cube! How long must I suffer this?
Karen: You're not letting him leave, are you? Can't you see? This is the perfect opportunity for revenge!
Plankton: Elaborate. [computer shows images of a Krabby Patty and SpongeBob]
Karen: Befriend the SpongeBob, then when the time is just right, take the Krabby Patty!
Plankton: Take the Krabby Patty? [runs back to the door]
Karen: Get moving, genius, don't let him get away.
SpongeBob: [Plankton opens the door] ...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields.
Plankton: Alright, SpongeBob, I'll play your little game.
SpongeBob: Great! [SpongeBob grabs Plankton and runs off] Last one to the fields is a rotten clam! [now at Jellyfish Fields] So, I get the big net and you get the little net. [hands Plankton a net bigger than him]
Plankton: What happens after we eat 'em?
SpongeBob: You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this! [captures a jellyfish] Like that.
Plankton: And?
SpongeBob: And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!
Plankton: Stingers? [Plankton imagines ruling Bikini Bottom with a jellyfish that only he controls] All knees will bow to Plankton! Hail, Plankton! I win, I win! [end of fantasy] I win, I wi--
SpongeBob: It's not about winning, it's about fun!
Plankton: What's that?
SpongeBob: Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a...
SpongeBob: What is fun? Let me spell it for you.  F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, N is for anywhere, anytime at all! 
Clams:  Down here in the deep blue sea. 
Plankton:  F is for fire that burns down the whole town, U is for uranium... bombs! N is for no survivors, when you- 
SpongeBob: Plankton! Those things aren't what fun is all about. Now, do it like this:  F is for friends who do stuff to- 
Plankton: Never! That's completely idiotic!
SpongeBob: Here, let me help you.  F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me.  Try it!
Plankton:  N is for anywhere, anytime at all! 
Clams:  Down here in the deep blue sea! 
Plankton: Wait, I don't understand this, I feel all tingly inside. Should we stop?
SpongeBob: No! That's how you're suppose to feel!
Plankton: Well, I like it. Let's do it again!
SpongeBob: Okay!
SpongeBob and Plankton:  F is for frolic through all the flowers, U is for ukulele. N is nose-picking, chewing gum, and sand-licking, here with my best buddy. Hahahahahahahaha! 
[Mr. Krabs is looking through a telescope at SpongeBob and Plankton]
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, mutiny.
[At the Chum Bucket, Plankton is changing clothes.]
Plankton: And after that, we frolicked through the flowers, and then we...
Karen: Sounds like fun.
Plankton: Well, the really fun part was when we...
Karen: What did you do with the Krabby Patty?
Plankton: The what? [shows a Krabby Patty on Karen's computer screen]
Karen: The Krabby Patty, remember?
Plankton: You can't rush these things, you know.
Karen: You're forgetting about the mission! [shows a formula]
Plankton: What are you talking about?
Karen: You're going native, Plankton! Look at yourself! [metal arm picks up Plankton and shows him wearing square pants like SpongeBob's]
Plankton: What?
[cuts to Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: I haven't seen Plankton in a while. He must be scheming.
SpongeBob: Who knows? Maybe he's changed.
Mr. Krabs: Who knows? I think you knows! [shows a picture of him and Plankton holding up the letters for FUN]
SpongeBob: He's changed, I tell you! [Plankton enters]
Plankton: SpongeBuddy! Yoo-hoo! [SpongeBob runs over to Plankton]
SpongeBob: Plankton-buddy! Let’s go! I forgot this is a no friend zone!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, may I speak to you in private. [talking to Plankton] You won't mind if I set this here, will you? [puts a plate with a Krabby Patty on the table and pushes it toward him]
SpongeBob: What's this all about, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: He's a thief. Look at the lust in his eye, he's...
SpongeBob: Why can't you just accept our friendship?
Mr. Krabs: He's just after me recipe. I'll prove it to you. [walks up to Plankton] Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here.
Plankton: Oh, yes, but I'm saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... suit yourself. [walks off then comes back to push the plate closer to Plankton. Uses a fan to get the smell to Plankton]
SpongeBob: We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs! [turns the fan off] Come on, Plankton, let's get out of here. [both walk away]
Mr. Krabs: Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton's gone straight. [plate falls down revealing that it was cardboard] And maybe scallops will fly out of my pants! [takes the boat and paddles to the movies] Hang on there, laddie, I'm a-comin! [at the movies, SpongeBob and Plankton are sitting in the front row. SpongeBob is giving popcorn to Plankton as he is eating some himself. Then Bubble Bass comes down and sits on Plankton, squishing him]
SpongeBob: I sure like sequels, Plankton. [sees Bubble Bass in his spot] Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend. [Bubble Bass meanly smiles and gets comfortable in his seat, and a squelching sound comes from Plankton being squashed by his butt] Hey, Bubble Bass! [throws some popcorn and Bubble Bass runs after it]
Plankton: Thanks for that, friend.
SpongeBob: Sure thing.
Mr. Krabs: Listen up! [Mr. Krabs shadow is on the movie screen]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? [in the projector room]
Mr. Krabs: He's deceiving ya! Reach into his pocket now and take what he's got! [the ladies didn't understand, so they reach in their husbands pockets and take out a watch, some money and a piggy bank then run off] You too, boy! [SpongeBob reaches into Plankton's pocket and takes out a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: [gasps] I cant believe this!
Plankton: It's not what you think.
SpongeBob: What is it then? Tell me what you see here!
Plankton: I... I don't see anything.
SpongeBob: [starting to cry] How can you not see it!? [groans]
Plankton: [beginning to tear up as well] Okay, okay, I see it! It's a Krabby Patty, okay?! I couldn't help it!
SpongeBob: But we sang The F.U.N. Song! [clutches his stomach] I think I'm gonna be sick! How long?
Plankton: How long what?
SpongeBob: [grabs Plankton, holding him in his fist] How long were you planning on doing this?! [tears well up in SpongeBob's eyes] Tell me!
[Plankton puts his head down and begins to sob.]
SpongeBob: [the tears now dripping down his face] What?!
Plankton: [looks up at SpongeBob] All right, it's true! I tricked you to get the Krabby Patty! But then you showed me friendship! [the two look each other in the eyes] And now I realize... that's all I really wanted!
SpongeBob: [sniffs, then smiles, beginning to stop crying] Really?
Plankton: [Plankton grabs the patty and jumps towards the screen] No, not really. Being evil is too much fun! [laughs evilly]
Movie Man: Oh, darling, I know that nothing could ever tear us apart. [Plankton rips through the screen]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won.
Mr Krabs: Ho-ho, no he didn't, boy! Don't you know what’s behind these screens? Solid concrete! [laughs. Plankton is squished on the wall groaning. Mr. Krabs takes the Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed.
Mr. Krabs: Don't blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty! Now let's go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh one on me!
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Well, maybe on a discount. [Mr. Krabs flicks Plankton off the wall and onto Bubble Bass' jelly beans]
Plankton: Huh? [Plankton runs around Bubble Bass's hand getting chased by his other hand] Yee... AAH!
SpongeBob: Ah, time for bed, Gary. [takes off shoes and socks but socks still standing up but when SpongeBob throws them on the floor, the socks go down and Gary puts them on his eyes]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary. [pulls socks off Gary's eyes] You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary. [snores and a dream cloud appears with the background of Krusty Krab stuff. SpongeBob eyes appear then his shoes and then his mouth on a rock] Hey! Over here! [laughs while his arms wiggle on the ground. Both arms attach to the rock and the rock moves over to the other items. SpongeBob's arms grab the eyes and puts them on the rock, his pants start appearing, and then his legs come out and put his shoes on and his body is seen. A car comes over SpongeBob and sits him in it. SpongeBob's nose grows out] Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license! [driver's license appears] Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it! [Car starts to move crazily] I sure take a good picture. [drives through a sign that says "Road Ends"] Darn! I should have grown a mustache. [the boat starts bumping up and down rapidly; SpongeBob is now driving off-road, hitting bumps in the sand; he smashes into a rock and flies out of the boat, still holding his license] How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt. [flies over the Krusty Krab] Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here. [Mrs. Puff floats up to him] Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!
Mrs. Puff: [takes his license and tears it up] Not even in your dreams, Mr. SquarePants!
SpongeBob: No! [flies through the dream cloud and on SpongeBob's real bed] Ouch! Where am I? [walks and looks up to his real self] Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
Gary: Meow. [snoring] Meow.
SpongeBob: [walks up to Gary's dream cloud] This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look. [jumps into the dream cloud. He falls down into a library] Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is. [walks past a pile of books] Gary! Huh? [sees Gary, who is now taller and wearing a cape, reading a book. He walks up to him] Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...? [Gary turns around]
Gary: [gasps] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Gary?
Gary: How dare you invade the sanctity of my dreams?
SpongeBob: Gary! You can talk!
Gary: [sighs] In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.
SpongeBob: What does that mean?
Gary: Come. [they walk down an aisle of books] For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm. [picks up a book and reads from it] "Let me not mar that perfect dream by an auroral stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again." Emily Dickinson wrote that.
SpongeBob: Who?
Gary: [flips a few pages] Here's one you might know. [clears throat] There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.
Gary: Did you think my shell was full of hot air?
SpongeBob: Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now. [starts walking away]
Gary: Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!
SpongeBob: [jumps out of Gary's dream cloud and hops up onto his alarm clock to get into his own; sees Patrick's dream cloud outside the window] I wonder what Patrick's dreaming. [Patrick is stuck to the bottom of his rock, sucking his thumb and snoring. SpongeBob runs over] I can't resist! [laughs and jumps into the dream cloud. Inside, he opens a door to see Patrick rocking back and forth on a 25¢ kiddie ride amidst the blank, white scenery] Hey, Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [walks over] You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
Patrick: Yup.
SpongeBob: I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper. [transforms into the shape of a skyscraper] Going up! Eh? [sees that Patrick is unresponsive and frowns, then perks up again] I can make... [changes back to his normal shape and size, this time with a million copies of himself] A million of me! Eh? Eh?
Patrick: Yup. [the clones disappear]
SpongeBob: Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream. [leaves]
Patrick: Okay. Bye, SpongeBob. [kiddie ride comes to a halt; Patrick reaches into his pocket and pulls out another quarter and goes to put it in the slot, but accidentally drops it and it rolls away] Oh! [the quarter falls into a grate] Shoot, that was my last quarter. [sits on the ride with a dull gaze; meanwhile, SpongeBob hops out of the dream cloud and starts to walk down the block; he stops below Squidward's dream cloud]
SpongeBob: Ooh, this is gonna be good! [inflates himself with air and floats up into the cloud; inside, Squidward is playing clarinet in front of an applauding crowd; he has a powdered wig on his head] Psst! Squidward! [waving in the audience; Squidward stops playing] Hey, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
King: Ahem! [sitting in the balcony above the stage] Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?
Squidward: Yes, Your Highness. [Squidward resumes playing, but SpongeBob tells the king a joke. The king laughs and Squidward stops playing again. He angrily stands up] SpongeBob!
King: Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play! [giggles, turns to SpongeBob and nudges him with his elbow] Oh, do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.
Squidward: [growling, pressing down on his clarinet] Sponge- [accidentally breaks the clarinet. The audience gasps] Bob...
King: [angry] I came here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it will be your head!
Squidward: [laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: [as a clarinet] Squidward! [points to himself and winks] Huh? Huh?
Squidward: [throws his broken clarinet pieces off-stage. Speaking with his back turned] No way.
King: Ahem! [glares down at Squidward]
Squidward: [sighs and picks SpongeBob up] Please, SpongeBob, no tricks.
SpongeBob: Trust me, Squidward. [Squidward blows into him]
SpongeBob: [off-key] La la! La la la la la la la! [The audience gasps again]
Squidward: [stops playing] SpongeBob!
King: [crying] Wh-wh-why have you stopped playing that wonderful music?
[Squidward smiles and SpongeBob winks at him]
SpongeBob: [continues singing off-key]
Fish: [crying] His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.
[crowd cheers]
Squidward: [bowing] Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! [the crowd knocks him aside into a fruit wagon and a fish grabs SpongeBob]
Fish: What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?
SpongeBob: [turns back to normal and runs away while audience chases him. Squidward has climbed out of the wagon and is a mess] So long, Squidward! [Squidward starts to growl at him, but the audience members push him back into the fruit wagon and chase after SpongeBob. The King follows, too, laughing. SpongeBob runs out the door and flies away.]
Squidward: [starts tossing and turning in his bed, mumbling in angered pain]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob lands on the top of the tree dome] Hey! I'm at Sandy's! [Sandy sleeps in her tree and SpongeBob jumps in her dream cloud and opens a plane door] Aw, this looks neat! I wonder... [falls out of the plane and screams]
Sandy: [surfs up on a glide board to SpongeBob] Hey, SpongeBob, what brings you here?
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy! What's going on?
Sandy: [turns upside down] Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target. [a target is shown on the ground and SpongeBob and Sandy spins around]
SpongeBob: This seems kind of dangerous!
Sandy: Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!
SpongeBob: Okay! [gives her a thumbs-up; both his shoes inflate]
Sandy: Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute! [turns upside-down again]
SpongeBob: Gotcha! [lifts up a green parakeet perched on his finger]
Sandy: Not a parakeet! Para- [Lands in a truck of clam manure, parachute inflates out of time] medic...
SpongeBob: [screams as he crashes through the target, breaking the ground and flips on the real-life ground] Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams. [sees a dream cloud coming out of Mr. Krabs' house] H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs. [climbs the anchor house and raises his head right under a pink flower in Pearl's dream. Shows a view of various girly decorations,other girly features and boyfriend portraits.] Uhh... Mr. Krabs?
Pearl: Hello, SpongeBob! [sits at a table with a green rabbit toy and a brown teddy bear, she pours some tea into the bear's cup]
SpongeBob: [waves] Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.
Pearl: You're just in time for the tea party!
SpongeBob: Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.
Pearl: [Frowns] Oh. He's next door. [Rolls eyes, then shakes head in disappointment] Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?
SpongeBob: Bye! [gets out of Pearl's dream and goes over to Mr. Krabs on the right side of the screen] I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust. [peeks in the cloud and just floats on his backside in the large ocean until he hits Mr. Krabs’ boat]
Krabs: I've got you now, you slippery demon! [inside the boat, he grips into a fishing rod] You're putting up a good fight, yes you are. [SpongeBob hops into the boat]
SpongeBob: Whatcha doin’, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: I'm picking Neptune's pocket!
SpongeBob: What are you talking about?
Krabs: I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash. [Moby Dollar appears from the water, caught on the fishing hook] It's the mighty Moby Dollar! [Starts reeling in, making the Moby Dollar come closer and closer.] Did you see her, boy? I got her! Here she comes! [Moby Dollar starts spitting out pennies] There she blows!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!
Krabs: Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!
SpongeBob: [grabs a small jellyfishing net] This one?
Krabs: No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.
SpongeBob: [reaches into Mr. Krabs' back pocket and pulls out a huge wallet with Mr. Krabs' license in it] Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.
Krabs: Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!
SpongeBob: [opens up the wallet] Net ready, sir!
Krabs: [pulls the dollar out of the water and heaves it into the wallet] I did it! [gets excited] I finally did it!
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs. [puts down the wallet and wants to shake hands with Mr. Krabs, but when he tries the wallet bounces toward the back of the boat; the wallet bounces away]
Krabs: No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!
SpongeBob: Huh?
Krabs: Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! [SpongeBob chases after it, but it hops off the back end of the boat]
SpongeBob: Hey! Hey! I...!
Krabs: No! [dollar hops out of wallet and jumps like a dolphin away in the ocean]
SpongeBob: This'll make a great fish story, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: [ties SpongeBob up with a rope tied to a plunger sticking out of a gun] You're fired! [Fires the gun, shooting the plunger and tossing SpongeBob with it]
SpongeBob: [screams as he gets shot out of the dream cloud and into Plankton's dream on a building. The plunger is stuck onto a building.] Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.
Plankton: Zap! [zaps a building near SpongeBob and fish come running out] I see you. [stomps up to another building, twenty times the size of his normal self] Zap! [shoots a green laser out of his eye]
Fred: My leg!
Plankton: I see you. Zap!
SpongeBob: Plankton! [tries to get himself untied from the rope around his ankle]
Plankton: I see you... [SpongeBob gets untied and drops to the ground] Zap! [zaps and disintegrates the building that SpongeBob was on, then walks to the Krusty Krab. People continue to scream in panic] Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. [stomps on it] Crush! [picks up the Krusty Krab sign and starts to lick it as if it were a lollipop and walks off] Lick, lick!
SpongeBob: This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!
Gary: Meow! Meow!
SpongeBob: [Stops and looks. Appears more and more worried.] Gary! Gary! No!
Gary: Meow! [Plankton still coming towards Gary making giant step sounds]
Plankton: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
SpongeBob: Gary! [jumps over to Gary and hugs him] I've got you, Gary!
Plankton: Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot! [steps on SpongeBob and Gary] Yeah! Huh? [lifts his foot from pain] Yow!
SpongeBob: [looking like a thumbtack] I think he's got the point. [laughs]
Plankton: [Starts shrinking.] Waaaaaah! [as he screams his voice gets higher and higher until he goes back to his normal, puny size. Three burnt fish walk up to Plankton looking mad] Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh? [Burned Fred lifts his foot to step on him] No! No! No! Not the face! [gets squished. Wakes up screaming and his dream cloud pops, making dream SpongeBob fall to the ground]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [SpongeBob walks home into his own dream cloud where his real self is still sleeping] Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud. [goes to sleep] Ah... [wakes up after hearing his friends voices and faces hovering around his head]
Squidward: [Head of Squidward starts surrounding SpongeBob] SpongeBob! [The heads of Mr Krabs, Sandy, Gary, Plankton, Pearl and Patrick start surrounding SpongeBob]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
Krabs: SpongeBob!
Patrick: SpongeBob!
Plankton: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [tossing and turning in his sleep] What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no! [Squidward taps him and he wakes up.]
Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [screams, then sees his friends stand around his bed, except Patrick] Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?
Squidward: No. We are not having a slumber party!
Sandy: Do us all a favor, SpongeBob, and stay out of our dreams!
All except Patrick: [grumble in agreement]
Plankton: Take a hike!
Squidward: Don't we get enough of you during the day?
Gary: [In anger] Meow!
Patrick: [walks in] Does anyone have a quarter? [all stare at Patrick]
[The episode starts off in SpongeBob's living room with him watching a sea anemone dancing on TV, his eyes widen and he moves a little closer. Gary comes up.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! [changes channel to a football game] Uh, I, I was just looking for the sports channel, Gary. [Someone is knocking on his door.] Come in!
Patrick: [Opens door and walks in] Hey, SpongeBob, wanna see my new shoes? [shows blue tennis shoes]
SpongeBob: Wow! Those are great, Patrick! Let's see what they look like on your feet.
Patrick: Uh... [pulls the shoes away] Wouldn't you rather see them on... [shows the shoes on his hands] My hands?
SpongeBob: Okay... [has white gloves on his feet] And we can wear gloves on our feet [turns around and has a top hat on his back] and hats on our captain's quarters, too. [shakes his butt]
Patrick: Uh, actually... I have a confession to make. [looks to see that no one is watching, leans to SpongeBob's "ear" and whispers] I don't know how to tie my shoelaces.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Do you know how lucky you are to have a friend like me?
Patrick: Yes. [SpongeBob places one foot on the chair]
SpongeBob: Look at this knot. Have you ever seen a more perfectly executed shoe-fastening bow?
Patrick: Gosh... Probably not.
SpongeBob: I learned when I was just a boy, Patrick, and I'm willing to pass on what I know. Go sit over there [Points off-screen behind himself] and let an old pro show you how to do it. [Patrick sits down in the chair and SpongeBob sets his foot on the chair's arm] Pay close attention, Patrick. Well, you start [unties his laces] by taking one lace per hand... [pulls a little on both laces] And then you... Uh, you gotta... Loop the, the...
Patrick: Are you sure you know how to do it?
SpongeBob: Patrick, please, shoe-tying requires peace and quiet. Okay, where was I?
Patrick: [SpongeBob gives him a dirty look] Your shoes are still untied. [SpongeBob takes his shoe off the chair]
SpongeBob: [looks away] Well, [Patrick looks shocked] I guess you don't want me to show you how to do it.
Patrick: I'm sorry! [covers his mouth with his shoes] I won't interrupt anymore!
SpongeBob: I've got it! The first rule of shoe-tying is always start with your right foot. Now the lesson will officially begin. [sets his right foot on the chair arm and unties his laces. Ties his laces, but they come undone. SpongeBob laughs nervously and tries again but the laces untie themselves once more. Patrick looks angry at him] That's... "knot" right. [laughs nervously] Get it? Knot... right... hmm...
Patrick: No.
SpongeBob: Okay, no more fooling around. [tries to tie the laces again off-screen] I've got it! [lifts up hands to show his fingers tied in a lot of knots. He laughs nervously. He turns around.]
Patrick: What was that? Are you okay, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [He turns around and looks angry at Patrick] Patrick, aren't you late for something?
Patrick: Oh, poop deck, You're right! [runs and bursts down SpongeBob's front door] We'll have to do this lesson [Off-Screen] later! Bye, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I can't believe I've forgotten how to tie my own shoes. They've been tied as long as I can remember. [flashbacks to being him as an egg with legs, socks, and shoes only] Well, I'll remember after a good night's sleep. [The scene changes to show the night scene with the island and the moon is shown. The scene changes to show the sunrise scene with the island is then shown. The scene changes to show SpongeBob is shown sleeping in his bed snoring with his shoelaces going back and forth. the clock turns to 7:00 am. The alarm goes off. SpongeBob wakes up and looks at his shoes and they are still untied] Oh... No big deal. I'll remember sooner or later. [The scene changes to show the outside of the Pineapple and he opens the front door. He is shown wearing his Krusty Krab uniform.] 'Cause I'm ready! I'm... read... [takes a step and trips] ...y! [stands up] I'm read... [takes another step and trips] ...Ooh! [stands up] I'm read... [takes another step and trips] ... Uh! [stands up] I'm read... [takes another step and trips] ...Ooy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Uh! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Duh! [repeats a few times]
[He makes it to the Krusty Krab where Patrick is eating a Krabby Patty. SpongeBob trips through the doors. Patrick notices SpongeBob.]
Patrick: Oh, hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, no! I can't let Patrick see I still haven't tied my shoes. [stands up and puts two holes through the floor with his feet]
Patrick: [Walks over to SpongeBob] Hey, SpongeBob... You're shorter. Have you been dieting?
SpongeBob: Well, a sponge has to look his spongiest. [walks to the kitchen putting a line of holes in the floor with his feet] Well, I've gotta get to work. [opens kitchen door and plops on the floor, face first. He grunts. He talks muffled by the fact that he hasn't stood up yet and is talking straight into the floor.] Oh, barnacles! Maybe I should just lay here.
Squidward: [peeks his head through the order window] Those patties aren't going to cook themselves, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: He's right! Got to make... Krabby Patties! [he holds out a spatula and gets up] Laces or no laces! [crawls over to the grill while grunting] Ah... I just have to stand in this one spot. [makes a Krabby Patty] Ta-da! A perfect patty.
Squidward: Alright, SpongeBob, hand it over. Well?
[SpongeBob takes a deep breath. Then imagines that Squidward is really far away. He also imagines his shoelaces as snakes that squeeze him then the hallucination goes away.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, I've got an idea! How about you come get it?
Squidward: [Sarcastically] Oh, gee, SpongeBob, that's a great idea. And maybe I should cook the patties, and do the dishes, and wear square pants, and live in a pineapple, while you wait in the unemployment line!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Then bring that patty here now!
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward. Here I come. I'm coming over. [scoots his feet across the floor inch by inch] I'm bringing the patty to you. Here comes the patty. No problem. I'm walking...the Krabby Patty...over to Squidward. All right, Squidward. I'm giving you the patty... For the hungry customer... So they can eat it... When I give it to you... Which is right... now. [holds out the patty, but the scene zooms out to show that SpongeBob never moved]
Squidward: Uh, SpongeBob? I'm over here! Now move!
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward. [looks down at his feet] Just slowly move your leg. Walk over there... with the... [tries to take a step but trips himself and sends the patty flying through the air at Squidward] Dah!
Squidward: SpongeBob! [the patty lands in his mouth]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward.
Squidward: [chewing the patty] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I'll just make another... Doh! [makes another patty but trips again throwing the patty towards Squidward]
Squidward: Sponge... [patty enters his mouth]
SpongeBob: Hold it... Doy! [makes another patty and trips again sending the patty into Squidward's mouth again] Let me just... [makes another patty] Doy! [he trips again and launches another patty. This continues for a while. Pretty soon, Squid is extremely huge. A group of customers is standing at the register. Old Man Jenkins pokes him.]
Old Man Jenkins: What's the holdup?
Squidward: [Squidward turns around and belches really loudly] I think my heart just stopped. [customers complain] It's Sponge... [burps] ...Bob's fault! ['SpongeBob's fault' echoes in SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: [He starts to tear up] I've failed. My career is over. I'm sorry, spatula. [puts down the spatula and takes his hat off] I'm sorry, hat. [puts it back on] I'm sorry, floor. [Takes a box of Krabby Patties from the wall and brings it to him and hugs it.] I am sorry, Krabby Patties. [lies in a puddle of tears. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs on the toilet working on a crossword puzzle, all of the answers he has given is the word "Money".]
Mr. Krabs: Let's see, a five-letter word for happiness. "Money." [laughs]
Customer: [Off-Screen] This is the worst service we've ever had! We're going to the Chum Bucket! [Mr. Krabs opens the bathroom door to see what the problem is]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Wait! Don't go! [his pants are on the ground]
Harold: Oh yeah, we are definitely out of here. [The customers continue to complain. Mr. Krabs runs over to the door, his pants are still on the ground.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Wait, don't go! That's me money walking out the door! What's the meaning of this, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: It's SpongeBob's fault. [Mr. Krabs gets upset. His eyes turn into steamboat whistles]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, get out here! [peeks out the kitchen door] More. [SpongeBob peeks out a little more] More. [SpongeBob stretches himself partially through the door] All the way, boy! [SpongeBob snaps out of the door and falls to the ground.] What be the matter, SpongeBob? I ought to make you walk the plank for this.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, it's just that I... I...
Mr. Krabs: Yes?
SpongeBob: I... I... I... I... I... I...
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes, yes?
SpongeBob: I... I... I... I... I...
Mr. Krabs: Out with it, boy! [He shakes SpongeBob] What is it?
SpongeBob: I forgot how to tie my shoes.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] That's all?
SpongeBob: So you'll show me how?
Mr. Krabs: I don't wear shoes. [close up on his feet. SpongeBob gasps, then runs over to Tom]
SpongeBob: Could you show me how to tie my shoes?
Tom: Uh, fins? [points to his feet. SpongeBob runs to an eel]
SpongeBob: Could you show me how to tie my shoes?
Eel: Well, I would, but, sadly, I am only an eel. [wiggles her tail in front of SpongeBob's face. SpongeBob runs to of the door to Jellyfish Fields]
SpongeBob: [He talks to three Jellyfish] Could any of you show me how to tie my laces? [The Jellyfish sting him. The scene changes to show SpongeBob looking under a rock of six Sea Urchins] Could you, you, you, you, or you show me how to tie a knot? [The Sea Urchins run off. The scene changes to SpongeBob looking at a creature in a cave] Could you show me how to tie a simple knot? [pair of eyes become multiple eyes and the monster eats SpongeBob. He notices a fisherman skeleton inside its mouth] Could you show me how to tie my shoes? [The monster shoots him out of its blow hole and onto the painting of the Captain] Could you show me how to tie my shoes?
Captain: Arr, I be just a painting of a head.
SpongeBob: [furiously yells] Doesn't anybody know how to tie a knot?! [lightning appears and it becomes night. The Flying Dutchman appears while laughing]
Flying Dutchman: Did somebody say knot?
SpongeBob: [eyes are large. he shakes in fear and his nose goes down.] I did.
Flying Dutchman: So, you want to tie knots, do ya? Well, do ya?!
SpongeBob: Yes, please, Mr. Flying Dutchman, sir.
Flying Dutchman: Then you've come to the right flying ghost, kid. You're looking at the first place winner in the fancy knottin' contest for the last 3,000 years!
SpongeBob: Hooray! [floats up into the air and turns into a heart]
Flying Dutchman: [grabs SpongeBob] You're gonna have to not do that. And stop staring at me with them big old eyes. [SpongeBob's eyes shrink] Now, stand back and watch me be knotty. [laughs and pulls out a rope] Haha! Behold! [rope is in pretzel shape] The pretzel knot!
SpongeBob: Ooh... [Flying Dutchman makes the rope into two diamond shapes]
Flying Dutchman: The double diamond knot! [holds the rope, now in the shape of a square, in front of SpongeBob] The square knot! [He pulls it away and it slithers over and squeezes SpongeBob] The constrictor! [Grabs SpongeBob and pulls him apart revealing a knot that looks like intestines] The gut knot! [Flying Dutchman makes a knot in the shape of a pillow] The pillow knot. [turns the knot over where SpongeBob is sleeping wearing a purple sleeping cap. Then, the Flying Dutchman makes the knot into a butterfly] The butterfly knot. [It starts to flutter away]
SpongeBob: Ooh...
Flying Dutchman: Wait, there's more! [SpongeBob takes out a pen and paper and his Jellyfishing glasses.] The monkey chain! [shows the rope as a chain] The monkey's fist! [shows the rope into a ball] The monkey! [shows the rope as a monkey]
Monkey Knot: Ooh, ooh!
Flying Dutchman: This one here's a loop knot, otherwise known as the 'poop loop'. [pulls the rope]
Rope: Poop!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Those are great, Mr. Flying Dutchman, sir. Now can you show me how to tie my shoes? [cut to close-up on SpongeBob's untied shoes]
Flying Dutchman: [laughs] I don't know how to tie me shoes. I haven't worn shoes for over 5,000 years! [He waves his tail around. He holds a sock with two blue stripes up] But sometimes I like to wear this little sock over me ghostly tail. [laughs as he flies off while lightning goes off. The scene changes SpongeBob crawling into his pineapple.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Not now, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm not in the mood, Gary.
Gary: Meow. [The scene changes to SpongeBob's bedroom. Off-Screen] Meow.
SpongeBob: [crawls into bed] Just leave me and me untied shoes alone, Gary [Gary roars like a lion, knocking SpongeBob off the bed and onto the floor] Okay, Gary, you have my attention.
Gary: Meow. [ties SpongeBob's shoes]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Gary! Well, I'll be! You can tie shoes! [Gary shows himself wearing shoes that look like old-style bowling shoes, under his shell] Hoppin' clams! How did you learn to do that? [Gary's shell opens revealing a record. The music starts and SpongeBob starts dancing.]
Ween: [song Loop dee Loop!]  Wanna learn how to tie your shoe? [The scene changes to show SpongeBob in a classroom wearing a teacher's outfit and on the chalkboard there are sketches of shoes.] It's a very easy thing to do. [Gary appears on a stool. SpongeBob puts on his glasses and taps the board with his pointer.] Just sit on down [Patrick appears in the desk next to SpongeBob.] and I'll give you the scoop, [Patrick holds out an ice cream cone and SpongeBob gives him a tied shoe that looks like SpongeBob's shoe. Patrick looks surprised.] What's that? [The scene changes to show the words "Loop Dee Loop" in shoelaces and SpongeBob pulls on two of the aglets.] It's called the loop-dee-loop. [The scene changes to show SpongeBob's leg with a untied shoe.] You gotta take a lace in each hand, [Two SpongeBobs hold an aglet in one of each's hands goes up and past the screen. The scene changes again to show the SpongeBobs crossing each other's paths.] You go over and under again. [The SpongeBobs come back around under the cross path that they made. The go upward and past the screen. They come back and pass each other's path one more time.] You make a loop-dee-loop and [The scene changes to show a small SpongeBob tying the lace of a big SpongeBob's shoe] pull. And your shoes are [The Big SpongeBob is shown wearing a top hat and giant shoes. He takes his hat off and kicks the newly tied shoe. It flies off.] lookin' cool. [The scene changes to show a SpongeBob multiplying into multiple SpongeBobs and follows the lyrics.] You go over and back, left to right, Loop-dee-loop [The scene changes to show SpongeBob holding his laces while jumping] and you pull 'em tight, [The scene changes to show SpongeBob with a bunny toy.] Like bunny ears [A present appears.] or a Christmas bow, [the Bunny toy becomes a bunny slipper and SpongeBob is seen wearing it and the present as shoes] Lace 'em up and you're ready to go. [SpongeBob runs out of the scene. The scene changes to show SpongeBob jumping off of a tight rope wire swing thing. He stops and spins around and then falls.] You make a loop-dee-loop and pull, [The scene changes to show SpongeBob and Gary falling into a giant shoe that looks like SpongeBob's shoe.] And your shoes are lookin' cool. [SpongeBob pulls on the laces and wings appear on both sides of the shoe and the shoe plane takes off. The Scene changes to show the plane passing giant tied shoe laces. The Shoe plane hits a roller coaster track and the wings fall off and it becomes a roller coaster car.] You make a loop-dee-loop and pull, [The shoe falls off of the track and lands on the ground] And your shoes are lookin' cool.
[The exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple is shown. The scene zooms into the interior of the pineapple, SpongeBob's bed room. His alarm clock goes off. SpongeBob gets up, still in his underwear, puts his blanket on like a cape, and uses the wind of the alarm clock to "fly" at his big calendar. He lands on the 20th day, which is a Sunday]
SpongeBob: Wow, it's Sunday, Gary! Guess what's for breakfast?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [The scene changes to show the two his kitchen. SpongeBob opens the door.] That's right! [puts a bowl on the kitchen counter] A sundae! [runs to the freezer and finds it empty] Whoops... Looks like we're out of ice cream. Guess I'll have to use something else... Ketchup! [Runs back to the bowl with a big bottle of Ketchup. He squeezes a bunch of ketchup into the bowl. He runs over to a cupboard] Hmmm... Bananas... Cherries... Boring. [closes cupboard door] Ah, here we go! Onions! [runs up to the counter with two sacks that say "onions" on them] Ready, Gary?
Gary: Meow. [Plays a violin while SpongeBob cries while peeling the onions into the bowl]
SpongeBob: Just one more thing! Pea... [opens up another cupboard, but finds an empty jar] ...nuts. Gary! [He walks over to Gary while shaking the empty jar] Our peanuts jar is totally empty! [Gary burps] Hmmm... [snaps fingers] Wait! I know one other place we can find peanuts. [looks in the bathroom and finds a peanut plant in front of the window] Good thing I still have these peanut plants growing in the windowsill. [throws the plant into the sundae bowl] A little texture never hurt. There we go. [gets out a spoon] This sundae's gonna taste great! [He turns around] Aren't you going to help me, Gary? Gary? Oh, well. More for me! [takes a few spoonfuls. Scene cuts to SpongeBob coming out of the kitchen with a bunch of stink coming out with him. He drops his spoon while Gary hides behind a coral plant] You know what they say, Gary. I'm easy like Sunday morning. ["morning" comes out of SpongeBob's mouth and wraps itself around Gary's eyes, twisting them. The scene changes to show SpongeBob outside his house] Okay, let's see my to-do list. [takes out a big long list] Go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work.. [his list "droops"] Wait, that's not right. I need the one for Sunday. [takes out a small piece of paper] Ah, here we go. 'Say hi to everyone in Bikini Bottom'. [runs off. Scene cuts to SpongeBob running up to a citizen] Hello. [citizen runs off in disgust of his bad breath. SpongeBob waves] Some people are even late on Sunday. [SpongeBob notices a mailman] Hi, Mailfish. [mailman smells SpongeBob's bad breath and he breaks his skin into a smaller fish and then into another smaller fish. SpongeBob hears a whistling noise] Hi, Mrs. Crossing Guard! [crossing guard gets a whiff of his bad breath]
Mrs. Crossing Guard: Mother of mercy! [children walk across the street and then the sound of a crashing car sounds, but it’s revealed to actually be a parade]
SpongeBob: Wow! A parade! Hi, parade! [the band stops] Hi, tuba player, hi, drummer, hi, guy with the cymbals, hi, trumpeter, hi tambourine girl, hi, timbale man, hi, didgeridoo player, [didgeridoo player wears a big skirt, hat, sunglasses] hi, triangle player, hi, guy with the kettle drum, hi, pianist, hi, guy with the flute. And heeelllooo, Dolly! [the stench ball rolls down the street, knocking the band out like a bunch of bowling pins and scattering them about. They all run out wailing in pain and disgust. The whole town is soon deserted]
Fish bands: My leg! My leg! [they all run away from the stench]
SpongeBob: Was it something I said? [he walks down the street] Something weird is going on today. Everyone is running away from me. And now... [he notices a giant pink wad on a bench] ...giant piles of bubble gum?! Oh, what next? [Patrick's head pops out from it]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob. [his appendages form from the wad]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Patrick. I'm confused.
Patrick: Yes, I am.
SpongeBob: Patrick, everyone is running away from me. Watch. [he walks over to a building] Hi, building! [the stench bounces off the building, and it slowly moves away. SpongeBob walks back to Patrick] I just don't get it.
[The stench goes toward Patrick, but bounces off him, as he has no nose.]
Patrick: I don't either. Maybe it's the way you're dressed. [pan up slowly at SpongeBob's clothes, looking fancy]
Both: Nah.
Patrick: Maybe it's your voice. [SpongeBob laughs for an extended time, then stops]
SpongeBob: Good one, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, maybe it's just because you're ugly.
SpongeBob: Ugly? [he puts a finger in his mouth, wipes his forehead with it, then strikes a pose. A spotlight goes off] You gotta be kiddin' me..
Patrick: Better try the reflection test. [he pulls out a large mirror]
SpongeBob: [to his reflection] Hi. [the stench hits his reflection, and the reflection takes a hammer and breaks the mirror. Pat peeks through it]
Patrick: Ugly.
SpongeBob: Oh no! I can't be ugly! I can't be! I can't be ugly! [he runs up to a couple] Am I ugly? [the two catch a whiff on the stench. The husband pulls down a hook, the two bites down on it and the hook is reeled in. SpongeBob runs off and latches onto a car's windshield] Am I ugly? [the stench goes around the glass and hits the driver's eyes]
Driver: My eyes! My eyes!
[the car swerves, spins around, throwing SpongeBob off, then explodes. All that's left is the charred frame, but a policeman gives it a ticket anyway. A tire bounces by and lands on SpongeBob, who is on the ground]
SpongeBob: Oof I'm ugly... [cut to night at SpongeBob's house. Lightning strikes repeatedly as Patrick walks in]
Patrick: SpongeBob, can I borrow some bath beads? [he walks through the dark house. He opens the library door. It's pitch dark, except for a light from the fire. SpongeBob mournfully plays Phantom of the Opera-style organ music. Patrick walks up to him, and he stops playing] SpongeBob? [the lights go on, and SpongeBob turns. He's wearing a Groucho Marx-esque nose and glasses, and a dark cape. He turns his back to Patrick]
SpongeBob: Go. Run away like all the others. No one would want a friend as ugly as I am. [he hits down on the organ]
Patrick: Sure they would! It makes them feel better about the way they look! Maybe a story will cheer you up. [he picks SpongeBob up, without glasses or cape, up and puts him in his comfy chair] It's called, 'The Ugly Barnacle.' [SpongeBob listens attentively] Once there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly that everyone died! The end. [Patrick grins, oblivious to his story's bad message]
SpongeBob: That didn't help at all. [he starts sobbing] How long? How long have I been ugly, Patrick?
Patrick: As long as I can remember. You poor ugly thing, you. [SpongeBob clings on Patrick]
SpongeBob: Help me! I'm so ashamed! I'm spiraling! I'm spiraling! [Patrick smacks SpongeBob in the face, twisting his head around] Thanks, Patrick. [Patrick holds his hand up again, and SpongeBob stops him, stammering] It's okay, Patrick. Spiraling, over.
Patrick: Just do what I do when I have problems. [screaming] Scream! [SpongeBob is covered with spit from Patrick. Patrick grabs SpongeBob and runs off] Come on, buddy. I'll help you. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick on the roof] Okay, now, say it. [SpongeBob hesitates] Say it.
SpongeBob: I can't.
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're never going to feel better unless you get this thing off your chest. [we see SpongeBob has a alien-like leach sucking on his chest]
SpongeBob: I know, Patrick. [he pulls it off and throws it aside]
Patrick: Say it. Say it.
SpongeBob: I'm ugly.
Patrick: You're ugly and what...?
SpongeBob: Square?
Patrick: No. Proud.
SpongeBob: I'm ugly and I'm proud.
Patrick: Good! Say it louder.
SpongeBob: [louder] I'm ugly and I'm proud.
Patrick: Louder.
SpongeBob: [louder] I'm ugly and I'm proud.
Patrick: Louder!
SpongeBob: [yelling] I'm ugly and I'm proud! [pan over to Squidward's roof, where he's tanning] I'm ugly and I'm proud! I'm ugly and I'm proud!
Squidward: Is that what he calls it? [SpongeBob is breathing heavily]
SpongeBob: That felt great! I feel empowered.
Patrick: So whaddya wanna do now?
SpongeBob: I don't know. How about a movie? [cut to 'The Reef' movie theater. SpongeBob and Patrick walk into a crowded theater. The two go down the front row] Pardon me. Ugly sponge coming through. [two fish smell SpongeBob's breath, their pupils turn to crosses, and they float upward]
Patrick: People respect self esteem. [he and SpongeBob sit down in the two now empty seats. SpongeBob leans over to a woman sitting next to him]
SpongeBob: Hi. I am very ugly. But you should enjoy the movie anyway. [the stench burns the woman's eyes, complexion, and hair off, and her head is now all charred. SpongeBob leans over Patrick to the man beside Patrick, who is a blue version of Fred] Excuse me, sir. I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you.
Fred: Not at all, boy. [sniffs] Deuueaugh! [Smells SpongeBob's bad breath. Makes a sourly disgusted expression, screams out a disgusted noise, and then quickly runs away]
Patrick: [to SpongeBob] Don't worry about him, SpongeBob. He's just a- [he notices his friend crying] SpongeBob? SpongeBob, what's wrong?
SpongeBob: [sobbing] I can't do this, Patrick! I've tried, and I've tried, [he turns around, revealing an extremely deflated face] but I'm not always as confident as I look. Maybe I'd better just go back and hide. [Patrick goes from sad to angry]
Patrick: [loudly] What is wrong with you people?! [he stands up, dropping his drinks in the process] Afraid to look ugliness in the face? [he picks up SpongeBob] Well, here! Look at it! [the stench pours into the audience] It's ugly, isn't it?! [he points SpongeBob at five people] You look at it!
SpongeBob: Hello.
[The fish run off. Patrick points SpongeBob at a larger group of people]
Patrick: You look at it!
SpongeBob: Hi.
[The fish run off.]
Patrick: [points SpongeBob at the whole audience] Look at it! [the entire room empties out] Look at it! Look at it! Look at it! I want all of you to look at it!
[Everybody screams in terror and they all run out of the theater in a panic. Patrick and SpongeBob are all alone in the theater]
SpongeBob: They all ran away, Patrick.
Patrick: I bet there's no line at the snack bar. [cut to the snack bar. Patrick leans over the counter] Hello...? Hello...? They must be on break.
[Patrick looks bummed out]
SpongeBob: Oh, wait, Patrick! I just remembered. [he reaches in his pocket and pulls out some of his sundae] I've got some of my peanut-onion sundae we can share!
[The fume of it floats past Patrick, burning off his eyebrows]
Patrick: That looks great! [closes his mouth on SpongeBob's hand, and sucks out the sundae. Patrick sighs with relief, but he starts to feel funny, His stomach makes engine spluttering noises] Oh, I gotta go to the restroom! [he runs off. Cut to the bathroom, where Patrick and Martin wash their hands at the sink] I'm out of soap, can I borrow- [the stench reaches the guy]
Martin: Stay back!
Patrick: I just want some-
[Martin takes out some money]
Martin: Here! Here's my money! [he drops it] Take it! Take it and go away!
[Martin runs off]
Patrick: My hands aren't that dirty... [he walks over to a line of three fish waiting at a stall] Hey, you guys want to hear a bathroom joke?
[Patrick's breath reaches the fish and they make disgusted noises.]
Clay: You tryin' to kill us?!
[The fish walk out murmuring. Patrick looks in the mirror.]
Patrick: [In shock] Oh... Oh! I caught the ugly!
[SpongeBob walks in]
SpongeBob: Patrick, is everything okay in here? [he hears Patrick sobbing. He opens a stall door and sees Patrick sitting on the toilet with a bag over his head] What are you doing in there, Patrick?
Patrick: Wouldn't you like to know?
SpongeBob: And why is that bag on your head?
Patrick: Why? Oh, no reason. Except you gave me the ugly! [he whips the bag off. SpongeBob recoils and gasps. Patrick walks out] What am I gonna do? I can't go out looking like this!
SpongeBob: Just remember what we talked about. There's power in pride.
Patrick: That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people. Now look at me! [his breath reaches SpongeBob and he holds his nose in disgust] I'm almost as ugly as you! I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do.
SpongeBob: Patrick...?
Patrick: What's my mom gonna say?
SpongeBob: [plugging his nose] Patrick?
Patrick: Oh my gosh, if my sister finds out, wait, I don't have a sister, if the bank, I mean it's one thing if you have bad shoes, or even bad hair, but... [SpongeBob screams at Patrick in rage to get his attention and stop his rambling as it works]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Calmly] You're not ugly. Your breath stinks. Really bad. [Patrick sighs with relief, his stench in the shape of a skull and crossbones]
Patrick: [Relaxed]Ahhhhhhhh, what a relief...
SpongeBob: [his eyes water from the foul smell] Arrgh, barnacles, Patrick! What did you eat?!
Patrick: Oh, some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
SpongeBob: No, I mean just this morning.
Patrick: Some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
SpongeBob: What else?
Patrick: Well, I had some of your sundae.
SpongeBob: Sundae... [he whips what's remaining of it out] Patrick! My sundae gave us rancid breath!
Patrick: Whatcha mean? [SpongeBob coughs as Patrick's breath flies by him]
SpongeBob: I mean, we're not ugly, we just stink!
Patrick: Stink? [the two cheer and run around in circles chanting]
Both: We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink!
[The fumes encompass the entire theater and it dissolves to the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick run out and run up to Squidward, who is looking through the window of a wig shop]
SpongeBob: Oh, guess what, Squidward?
Both: We stink! [the two hug Squidward, and then run off, still cheering] Oh yeah! We're smelly! I reek! Smell me! [the two run off until they're out of sight]
	Narrator: Ah, the Krusty Krab. Home of the Krabby Patty, with its top secret formula, known only to those who are brave enough and intelligent enough to comprehend its culinary complexity. [SpongeBob is balancing a spatula on his nose behind the register]
SpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs. I'm doing it, I'm doing it!
Mr. Krabs: Quit fooling around, SpongeBob, we got customers.
Narrator: But wherever there's a secret recipe, there is someone who wants to steal it. [Plankton laughs evilly while standing in the head of a robot fish. The head falls down]
Plankton: Ouch! [robot's arm turns into a mirror] And now for the final touch. [puts on a mustache] Perfect! With this disguise, that formula is as good as mine. [laughs then wheels himself into the restaurant]
Fish Robot: Are you SpongeBob SquarePants? [SpongeBob looks in a mirror]
SpongeBob: Why, yes. Yes I am. [the fish robot holds up a big check]
Fish Robot: Then you've just won one million dollars! [SpongeBob gasps] You just have to answer one question. What is the Krabby Patty secret formula? [SpongeBob inhales] Yes? [SpongeBob inhales more] Yes? [SpongeBob inhales even more] Yes?!
SpongeBob: [speaking rapidly fast] The Krabby Patty formula is the sole property of the Krusty Krab and is only to be discussed in part or in whole with its creator, Mr. Krabs. Duplication of this formula is punishable by law. Restrictions apply, results may vary. [SpongeBob smiles, the mustache falls off the robot, shakes, then Plankton crashes through the teeth]
Plankton: [growls] That's it?! [jumps on SpongeBob's nose and holds his eyelids] You'd better cough up that secret formula or else!
Mr. Krabs: Plankton!
Plankton: [Looks at Mr. Krabs] Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Plankton!
Plankton: Krabs!
SpongeBob: SpongeBob. [Mr. Krabs grabs Plankton and a straw, then puts Plankton in the straw]
Plankton: You can't do this to me, Krabs! [Mr. Krabs blows Plankton back to the Chum Bucket] I went to college! [Plankton crashes into his restaurant] Ouch.
Mr. Krabs: That Plankton is a clever beast. You've got to keep a sharp eye out for him, SpongeBob. The Krabby Patty law must be enforced. The future of the Krusty Krab depends on it.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, as long as these pants are square, [grabs himself] and this sponge is Bob, [lifts his arms up] I will not let you down!
Mr. Krabs: Uh, SpongeBob? [camera zooms out to reveal SpongeBob holding Mr. Krabs above his head] Could you let me down? [cut to later, at the Krusty Krab]
Fish: Man, these patties sure are delicious. I wonder what's in that secret formula. [siren goes off. SpongeBob slides down the pole from the crow's nest]
SpongeBob: Code twelve, code twelve! [SpongeBob bounces off a trampoline and grabs the customer's head] Your disguises can't fool me this time, Plankton! [pulls the head off to reveal a smaller head on the customer; everyone gasps]
Fish: Everyone at the head enhancement clinic said nobody would notice! [runs off crying]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're scaring away me money!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was just trying to protect the secret formula.
Mr. Krabs: That's no reason to rip other people's heads off, boy. Just remember the most important rule.
SpongeBob: No free napkins?
Mr. Krabs: No! the other most important rule. Regarding the secret formula.
SpongeBob: Only discuss the formula with Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: As long as you do that, the secret is safe.
Squidward: I always thought the most important rule was "why do today what you can put off till tomorrow?" [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: What is today, but yesterday's tomorrow?
Squidward: Huh? [cut to Mr. Krabs and Squidward in a storage room]
Mr. Krabs: Today, I want you to take inventory on everything in here; every last pickle and patty must be accounted for.
Squidward: Aye aye, captain. [Mr. Krabs leaves. When Squidward walks over to the stock, glowing eyes appear; Squidward writes something on a notepad] Two boxes of buns. Three pounds of patties.
Imitation Krabs: [mechanical voice] Mr. Squidward...
Squidward: What now, Mr. Krabs?
Imitation Krabs: That's right, I am Krabs.
Plankton: Your boss, your ruler, your master! [laughs evilly]
Imitation Krabs: Ha, ha, ha. [exhaust smoke spurts out]
Squidward: You're not Mr. Krabs.
Imitation Krabs: Hey, why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Squidward: [chuckles and runs to the door] Well... whatever you say, "Mr. Krabs." [laughs] Whoopee! [runs out as SpongeBob walks in]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Plankton: Oh, sweet domination. This is it!
SpongeBob: No sign of Plankton, yet. Gosh, Mr. Krabs. You don't look so good. [touches his body] Ooh, you're so cold. [knocks on his pants]
Imitation Krabs: That's just my metal suit. I made it to protect the formula.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [second "SpongeBob!" echos]
Plankton: It's that thick-headed Krabs. He'll ruin everything.
Imitation Krabs: Look, a jellyfish. [SpongeBob takes out his net and runs around]
SpongeBob: I got it, I got it.[Plankton presses the "Abort" button. When he does, Imitation Krabs shrinks into a toaster] I got it, I got it [Mr. Krabs enters]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob stops and looks at the toaster, which releases its toast, then looks at Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: [knocks on Mr. Krabs' pants] Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happened to your metal pants?
Mr. Krabs: Don't get all loopy on me, boy. I need your help. And where in the high seas is Squidward?
SpongeBob: You gave him the day off.
Mr. Krabs: [pupils shrink] Day... [bellows] ...oooooooooff?! [Mr. Krabs is so mad that he makes steam come out of the chimney] I don't know the meaning of them horrible words! [SpongeBob falls down] Now quit your laying around, SpongeBob, and take out that garbage! It's starting to give me a rash. [exits]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir! [puts a clothespin on his nose and is going to take the trash out, but Imitation Krabs stops him] Hey, Mr. Krabs, just taking out that garbage.
Imitation Krabs: Never mind that. I need to talk to you. [takes the trash bag and vaporizes it with his laser eyes]
SpongeBob: Whoa-ho, Mr. Krabs. I didn't know you had heat vision.
Imitation Krabs: Never mind. I need you to tell me...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
Imitation Krabs: Yoinks! [runs off]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm not paying you to stand around. [gives him a spatula] Get back to the kitchen!
SpongeBob: But I thought you wanted to ask me a question.
Mr. Krabs: Yes... why aren't you working harder?
SpongeBob: [slowly] I don't know, Mr. Krabs... I don't know. [both walk out]
Plankton: I'll never get that formula with that pest Krabs popping in and out like that. I've got it! I've been saving this for a rainy day. [holds up a penny] It looks like an ordinary penny... because it is an ordinary penny! That fool Krabs is too greedy to ignore you, my little pretty. [laughs evilly. The penny pops out of the nose and rolls around into Mr. Krabs' office]
Mr. Krabs: That sound, it sounds like... the pitter-patter of... [sees the penny] money! [squeals] Hey, where you going, beautiful? [SpongeBob knocks on Mr. Krabs' door]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs... [the penny slides out of the office] Wha... [Mr. Krabs busts down the door on top of SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Stop! Please! [the penny slides between the crack of the doors and rolls away with Mr. Krabs running after it] Wait! [Robot Krabs is hiding behind the sign pole]
Imitation Krabs: Nothing stands between me and that secret formula now. [snaps off some of the Krusty Krab sign pole. As he laughs evilly, the sign falls on top of him] Ouch! [cut to SpongeBob, who is scrubbing the floor]
SpongeBob: Scrub-a-dub-dub, I love to rub. [Robot Mr. Krabs rolls by] Hey, Mr. Krabs, just doing a little scrubbin'.
Imitation Krabs: Hello, SpongeBob, it is me, Mr. Krabs. [exhaust pipe smokes] In the flesh. [exhaust pipe smokes again] Standing right in front of you. [pipe smokes again] With no one else around.
SpongeBob: I can see that, Mr. Krabs.
Imitation Krabs: I thought we might discuss the Krabby Patty secret formula. [a microphone comes out of Imitation Krabs]
SpongeBob: Isn't that a microphone?
Imitation Krabs: What? Why, yes it is. [puts microphone back inside his body] I must get this shirt cleaned. Alright, now tell me the secret formula.
SpongeBob: But, sir, we haven't done the secret handshake yet.
Imitation Krabs: Oh yes. Here, let's shake.
SpongeBob: [laughs] We don't shake with our hands, remember?
Imitation Krabs: Uh, right, why don't you start?
SpongeBob: We stand on one foot. [they do] Balance a glass of chocolate milk on our heads and sing the Bikini Bottom National Anthem. [they do]
Music: "Bikini Bottom National Anthem"
Oh, Bikini Bottom, we pledge our hearts to you, As faithful, as deep, as true, as blue, Bikini Bottom, we love you!
Imitation Krabs: Formula time?
SpongeBob: Almost.
Narrator: Six and a half hours later... [Plankton grunts frantically as he gets Robot Krabs into a cannon which spits him out, through a flame ring, and onto a chair at a table. He opens up the robot's belt buckle and dumps some spaghetti in there]
Imitation Krabs: Yum yum, this spaghetti sure is good. Belch!
Music: "The Spaghetti Song"
Meatball. Meatball. Spaghetti underneath. Ravioli. Ravioli. Great Barrier Reef. [They clap]
Imitation Krabs: Okay, now let's hear that formula.
SpongeBob: Sorry, [takes off his chef mustache] no can do, Mr. Krabs. [Robot Krabs' eyes are on fire]
Imitation Krabs: Whaaaaaaaaaat?!
Plankton: [exploding in rage] But we did everything you said-- I followed all the rules! I even ate 105 black licorice jellybeans through a straw!
Imitation Krabs: Now why can't you tell me the formula?
SpongeBob: It's your rule. Never speak the formula. You told me to keep it in...this bottle. [holds up a bottle with a piece of paper in it]
Plankton: [Imitation Krabs opens its eyes, Plankton is overly excited and tense] This is it, Plankton. Gently, now... [pushes on a lever that makes Robot Krabs' arm stretch out more. A penny rolls through the door and Mr. Krabs comes in. Everyone gasps, including the guy on the penny]
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps]
SpongeBob: [Gasps]
Guy on the Penny: [Gasps]
Imitation Krabs: Gasp!
Mr. Krabs: How could you do this, SpongeBob? Giving me secret formula to this imposter?!
Imitation Krabs: Don't listen to him, SpongeBob. Remember: Ravioli, ravioli, give me the formuoli.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, no! Don't listen to him. I'm the real Mr. Krabs.
Imitation Krabs: Don't listen to him. He's obviously a robot. [exhaust pipe smokes]
Mr. Krabs: Well, if I was a robot, which I'm not, at least I'm well put together. Not some rusted-out, steam-driven piece of junk!
Imitation Krabs: Who are you calling steam-driven...?
SpongeBob: [unable to handle the pressure, explodes in frustration] Quiet! [SpongeBob is holding a giant hose in his hands and his eyes bloodshot] Until I know who the real Mr. Krabs is, nobody moves, [it is soon revealed that the hose is attached to a large tartar sauce machine] nobody gets hurt.
Mr. Krabs and Imitation Krabs: Tartar sauce?!
Mr. Krabs: Take it easy with that thing, son. [SpongeBob squirts some tartar sauce at Mr. Krabs causing him to jump into Imitation Krabs' arms]
SpongeBob: I'll do the talking around here. I think I'll just ask you two a couple of questions. Questions only the real Mr. Krabs could answer.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, then.
SpongeBob: First question: What time does the Krusty Krab open?
Imitation Krabs: [beats Mr. Krabs to it] 9:30 A.M.
SpongeBob: Right. [to Mr. Krabs] That's one strike, Mr. Fake.
Mr. Krabs: But...
SpongeBob: Nuh-uh-uh! I'm running this quiz show, I'll ask the questions. If there's gonna be any 'buts,' they're gonna be from me. Okay, question number two: How much does a Krabby Patty cost?
Mr. Krabs: $2.99!
SpongeBob: On Wednesday...
Imitation Krabs: 99¢!
SpongeBob: Right again! [to Mr. Krabs] You're starting to look pretty phony right about now. I'd be nervous if I were you. Now only the really real Mr. Krabs could answer this — If we're discussing the secret formula on the third Wednesday in January and it's not raining outside after we've gargled with vanilla pudding, what do we do?
Mr. Krabs: That's an easy one. You just...just... let's see... if its..uh.. if it's January... with...with vanilla pudding...you...uh...pass? [Mr. Krabs is shot out of the Krusty Krab with tartar sauce into a fry basket] Wait, SpongeBob! Give me another chance! [Rolls away in the basket] No!
SpongeBob: So long, Imitation Krabs! Buh-bye! [walks back inside] I knew it was you all along, Mr. Krabs, here you go. [holds up the formula bottle]
Imitation Krabs: Thank you, SpongeDupe. [grabs the bottle and laughs mechanically. SpongeBob sees a penny on the ground]
SpongeBob: Oop! Don't forget your lucky penny. [puts the penny inside a slot on Imitation Krabs that is labeled "Self-Destruct: 1 cent"]
Imitation Krabs: Yoinks.
SpongeBob: This must be your lucky day. [laughs]
Karen: The self-destruct coin slot has been activated. Ten seconds 'til detonation.
Plankton: Coin-operated self-destruct? Not one of my better ideas. Heeeeeeeeeeeeeelp! [screams as he wheels back to the Chum Bucket, but explodes when he gets inside. The giant hand thuds on top of him] Ouch! [the formula bottle rolls back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [Picks up the formula, realizing his mistake] If that was Plankton... Uh-oh!
Mr. Krabs: Help! Get Away! No!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs! [runs to Mr. Krabs, who is still in the fry basket using a fry to fight off Hans who has a fork]
Hans: Mmm…yum-yum.
Mr. Krabs: Back, you hungry hand, back! Help! [SpongeBob wheels Mr. Krabs back to the Krusty Krab safely]
SpongeBob: Gee, Mr. Krabs. I'm sorry. I thought you were a phony.
Mr. Krabs: Phew, that's okay, me lad. Long as the secret formula's safe again. [takes the bottle] However, that penny's coming out of your paycheck. [both laugh]
SpongeBob: Really?
[It's another day at Mrs. Puff's Boating School as SpongeBob skids along his way to failing his driving test again]
Narrator: Here we are again at the Bikini Bottom Boating School. Today is once again the day of SpongeBob's boating school exam. But more importantly, this is the last test for the year, [cut to a shot of SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff's car coming straight to the camera] and if SpongeBob does not pass this one, it means another [panicked] whole year of boating school! [Shows a static scene as SpongeBob crashes into the camera and glass breaks. Back on regular view, the cameraman is seen to have fallen over. Narrator groans.]
SpongeBob: [dazed] Whahappen? [sic]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, nothing, SpongeBob, you just struck another pedestrian. [writes on clipboard] Minus 20 more points.
SpongeBob: How many does that leave me with?
Mrs. Puff: Negative 224.
SpongeBob: How many more minutes left in the test?
Mrs. Puff: The test is over.
SpongeBob: That's enough time, I can make up those points! [SpongeBob is about to pull into reverse]
Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, you didn't hear me! [the boat rams into reverse and Mrs. Puff screams] It's too late, SpongeBob! [Mrs. Puff pleads SpongeBob to stop as he knocks over a whole row of cones, knocks through a brick wall and crashes in front of the school's main building. The dust clears]
SpongeBob: Okay, Mrs. Puff, what's my final score?
Mrs. Puff: Six.
SpongeBob: Whoo! And how many do I need to pass?
Mrs. Puff: Six.
SpongeBob: [raising arms slowly] Whoo.
Mrs. Puff: Hundred. [SpongeBob stops]
SpongeBob: What?
Mrs. Puff: 600. You need 600 to pass. You got six.
SpongeBob: Don't worry. I'll be all right, Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year! [he slams his fist down, which causes a piece of the motor to fly upward] Well, see you next Tuesday! [SpongeBob walks off and the piece crashes on Mrs. Puff. She inflates like she always does when SpongeBob crashes. SpongeBob runs out to his unicycle-like bike] Yeah! [singing] I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more superduper year. [goes around in circles on his bike] One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year! [Mrs. Puff looks on, still inflated]
Mrs. Puff: [thinking] Oh, Neptune. Another year with him! Barnacles! Dirty barnacles! I've got to do something to save myself. Oh, there's only one way out: a teacher's ace in the hole! [starts to talk, when she does, she deflates to her normal size] Extra crediiiiit!
SpongeBob: What was that, Mrs. Puff? [Mrs. Puff runs over and shakes him in joy]
Mrs. Puff: Extra credit, SpongeBob! The extra credit! [laughing wildly] I still have a chance! I mean, you still have a chance.
SpongeBob: What's extra credit?
Mrs. Puff: It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before.
SpongeBob: [singing] Oh….. [cut to SpongeBob at his desk]
Mrs. Puff: Now, are we ready for that extra credit?
SpongeBob: Extra credit!
Mrs. Puff: That's the spirit. So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class, and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a ten-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school.
SpongeBob: But I've learned so many things.
Mrs. Puff: Just pick one, I don't care which. Here, I'll help you get started. [SpongeBob writes what she says] "What I learned in boating school is…" There! That's already seven words! Only three more!
SpongeBob: [writing] L… e… a… r… [pencil snaps] Oh, barnacles.
Mrs. Puff: What's wrong?
SpongeBob: Got to sharpen my pencil. [SpongeBob whistles as he walks to the sharpener. He then sharpens it multiple times to get just the right sharpness. Mrs. Puff begins to sweat. SpongeBob is finally satisfied and walks back to his desk] N… e… [pencil breaks again, he walks to the sharpener again, Mrs. Puff stops him, grabs the pencil and holds out a pen]
Mrs. Puff: Give me that! Here's a pen.
SpongeBob: A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils. [walks back to desk singing] Gonna write an essay, that's what I say. [SpongeBob finishes] There.
Mrs. Puff: Fantastic, let me see it.
SpongeBob: No, wait! I changed my mind! [erases some stuff out]
Mrs. Puff: I'm sure whatever you've written is fine, just let me see. [SpongeBob jumps on top of his paper]
SpongeBob: Don't look! It's not ready.
Mrs. Puff: It's so simple, only ten words! "What I learned in boating school is blankity, blankity, [her eyes grow bulging veins] Blank!"
SpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this!
Mrs. Puff: "What I learned in boating school is…!" "What I learned in boating school is…!"
SpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this! [starts to pant] Is it hot in here, Mrs. Puff? Why is it so hot in here? [screams] My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff! Make it stop! [Mrs. Puff jumps on SpongeBob and forces the pen to push on the paper]
Mrs. Puff: You only need three… more… words! [the desk finally collapses and breaks, as Mrs. Puff falls on top of SpongeBob; Mrs. Puff gets off, and reaches for the essay] Okay, let me see what you've written. [SpongeBob grabs it]
SpongeBob: It's not ready yet.
Mrs. Puff: It's okay, SpongeBob. Show the teacher what you've written.
SpongeBob: No!
Mrs. Puff: Give it to me! [the two pull on it]
SpongeBob: No!
Mrs. Puff: Let me see it! [the page rips in half; Mrs. Puff grabs SpongeBob's piece and attempts to read it] "What I learned in boating school is…" Uh… [on the page, it says 'What I learned in boating school is how to drive.' 'School,' 'how' and 'drive are crossed out and below are pictures of a boat, SpongeBob and a jellyfish] Well, the rest doesn't matter! [throws the two pieces on the floor] You pass! [laughs] You pass!
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything.
Mrs. Puff: That's how extra credit is supposed to feel.
SpongeBob: Really?
Mrs. Puff: Besides, here's your license. [gives it to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: My license! [licks it] It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I-
Mrs. Puff: [dragging him out the door] Thank you, SpongeBob. Congratulations, and have a nice life!
SpongeBob: Look out, Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants! [echoes] SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants! [fades to a vision of Mrs. Puff's fears] La La La La! [he hits many pedestrians] La La La La! [he crashes through Harold and Frank]
Fish: [crushed by the bus when SpongeBob hits it] Ow!
[A small birthday party is going on]
Partygoers: Harris, happy birthday! [SpongeBob runs over them] My leg!
News Reporter: So much destruction...this reporter asks, "Why?" Local consensus places the blame on this negligent, selfish driving instructor who- [SpongeBob runs him over] Oof!
SpongeBob: La la la la!
Reporter: Let's- not- use that take. [Fades to reality]
Mrs. Puff: That's preposterous. He did the extra credit. There's no need to worry. He doesn't even have a boat to drive. [Later that night while walking home] Now to go home and have the rest of that pasta.
[she opens the door and turns on the light to see the SquarePants family standing in the center of her living room with a huge round cake in the middle saying, "Thank You, Mrs. Puff! "]
The SquarePants': Surprise!
SpongeBob: To the greatest teacher ever!
Mr. SquarePants: Thank you, Mrs Puff. I know I speak for everyone when I say that we consider you a member of the SquarePants family. [kisses her hand for a long while]
Mrs. SquarePants: I think you made your point, dear.
Mr. SquarePants: Ahem. [blushes, and walks back to the family] Mrs. Puff, we were starting to think SpongeBob was never going to get his license. But you never gave up on him, you never quit, you never took the easy way out!
Mrs. Puff: Well, I... Okay.
Mrs. SquarePants: We wanted to make sure Mrs. Puff, the greatest driving teacher in the world, was here to see this...
Mrs. Puff: See what?
Mr. SquarePants: Ta-da. [reading back license plate] "IM-RDY".
Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob: A brand new boatmobile?!
SpongeBob: For me...? [faints and hits the cake, cutting out a perfect square. The family is in the car ready to drive away with SpongeBob still passed out in the backseat]
Mrs. SquarePants: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff... He'll be driving by tomorrow! Toodle-Loo!
Mrs. Puff: What have I done?! Everyone will know I let him slide through school! I'll have to move to new city, start a new boating school with a new name! No. Not again. I've got to end this before it begins.
[In SpongeBob's bedroom, he's laying in bed with his parents overlooking him]
Mr. SquarePants: You took quite a buster there, Son.
SpongeBob: What I learned in Boating School today is!
Mr. SquarePants: We're gonna have to hold off on the driving there for a while, son.
Mrs. SquarePants: That's right, honey. Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat.
[SpongeBob peeks out to see if it's all clear, then slides through the window and floats to his new boat]
SpongeBob: Hi, Boaty. [he runs his hand on the side of the boat and gasps] Boaty, you're cold! [he stands up and lays his socks on the side of the door] Take my socks. [he jumps on the side and hugs it] Oh, Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea! [he kisses the throttle lever, sighs, then falls asleep. On the horizon, a shifty dark figure runs by. It's Mrs. Puff, wearing a black ski mask. She peeks over and jumps into the boat, checking to see if the coast is clear]
Mrs. Puff: I hope I still remember how to do this. [she takes out a purple balloon and blows it up. She then forms it into a balloon animal and snickers to herself] Oh yeah… [she starts the boat and drives off. What she doesn't know is that she's sitting on an asleep SpongeBob. He wakes up and sees the sky moving]
SpongeBob: Hey, I'm driving! [the two notice each other and scream. Mrs. Puff skids off the road for a bit, then returns to normal. SpongeBob jumps up] Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask?! Because you're not skiing! [gasp] Oh my gosh, I know who you are!
Mrs. Puff: [nervous] No, you don't! You don't know who I am!
SpongeBob: Yes, I do! I know that you're... a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray! [takes it out. He sprays, but the nozzle's pointed the wrong way, it gets in his eyes and he screams in pain] Somebody help me! Somebody help me! [Mrs. Puff kicks SpongeBob out of the boat]
Mrs. Puff: Sorry, SpongeBob, but it was for your own good. [we see SpongeBob supposedly running next to the boat, but he's actually riding his bike. Mrs. Puff speeds up faster and loses him]
SpongeBob: Give me back my boat! [SpongeBob finally catches up to Mrs. Puff and slaps his hand on the windshield. He grabs with both hands and jumps up. Mrs. Puff skids and swerves to get him off, but he's not budging] You'd better stop this boat! [Mrs. Puff slams the brake and SpongeBob falls to the ground. He's still hanging on and running] I'm… not… letting… go! Nothing will stop me! Not even… [gasps. He sees a sign reading…] Giant clams?! [so, SpongeBob is dragged through a field of giant clams. He comes out with a bunch of pieces missing from him] I'm… not… letting… go… even for… [gasps, when he sees another sign for…] Cheese graters?! [so, he skids through the cheese graters. Now he's just four yellow sponge strands with arms] If you think I'll let go for a little… [he then approaches the most dreaded sign of them all…] educational television?! Oh, no! [cut back to Mrs. Puff as she hears SpongeBob's scream]
Mrs. Puff: Looks like that got rid of him. Now for some tunes! [she turns on the radio, which bears a striking resemblance to SpongeBob. It is SpongeBob, in the shape of a radio: his eyes are knobs, his mouth is the speaker, and so on]
SpongeBob as Radio: And now back to KRUD, with all of your personal "you won't get away with stealing my car!" hits. [Mrs. Puff screams as SpongeBob squeezes out of the box and jumps on Mrs. Puff. They get into a giant brawl and the car goes out of control. Two cops look on]
Officer Rob: Hey, look. [the car then flies off a cliff and straight for the squad car. The cops scream in horror and clutch each other. While plummeting, SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff are still brawling]
SpongeBob: I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were… [he rips off the ski mask, revealing who the culprit is] … Mrs. Puff? [SpongeBob flaps his lips in disbelief in a hypnotic background as the car crashes into the police car. Seconds later, the siren goes off. Later, SpongeBob is calling Mrs. Puff on the phone. Every time a person talks, it cuts to them] So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: Uh, SpongeBob? I'd like to… apologize. I never should have passed you. You really weren't ready.
SpongeBob: So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?
Mrs. Puff: I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting a new class Monday morning.
SpongeBob: You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student [cut to see that Mrs. Puff is talking to SpongeBob from jail, through that visiting window]. And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor?
Mrs. Puff: What's that? [pan out from the jail exterior]
SpongeBob: [from inside] Free driving lessons! [laughs]
[The Krusty Krab at night. The lights are still on]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, SpongeBob! It's quittin' time! [the lights turn off and Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk out] I've got a card game tonight. [he locks the doors]
SpongeBob: Who're you playing cards with, Mr. Krabs? [we see the Chum Bucket across the street, with its lights still on]
Mr. Krabs: I'm going over to the Chum Bucket to play with Plankton. [SpongeBob gasps]
SpongeBob: [Gasps] Plankton?! [a thought bubble appears over SpongeBob's head with Plankton inside] But, Mr. Krabs, he's your arch-enemy! [he picks up a Krabby Patty] He's been trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula for years! [the Plankton in the thought bubble sees the Krabby Patty and goes to get it, but SpongeBob squishes him with a fly swatter]
Plankton: Ouch. [the thought bubble disappears]
SpongeBob: Why would you play cards with him?
Mr. Krabs: Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom! [cut to him and Plankton holding cards and a giant stack of money on the table] Why, I've been taking him to the cleaners every Thursday night for fifteen years! [Mr. Krabs puts his cards down on the table and rakes in his money with his claws. Back to the present, Mr. Krabs' eyes have turned to dollar signs] I never lose! [the two start laughing and walk off their separate ways. Cut to the morning where Mr. Krabs walks to work crying, and SpongeBob walks in laughing]
SpongeBob: Taking him to the cleaners! That's a hot one! [Mr. Krabs leans against the Krusty Krab doors] How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I lost.
SpongeBob: Barnacles, Mr. Krabs. How much money did you lose?
Mr. Krabs: I didn't lose any money. [he sheds away a tear] I lost...
SpongeBob: Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: I lost... [SpongeBob grabs him]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!
Mr. Krabs: I lost... [he points to SpongeBob] you!
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: I bet your contract and I lost. [SpongeBob stares blankly, then laughs]
SpongeBob: Good one, Mr. Krabs. Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties. [he begins to walk to the door, but Mr. Krabs' claw stops him. After continually walking and getting nowhere, he falls to the floor]
Mr. Krabs: I'm afraid you don't work here anymore. [Squidward runs out the door to the two]
Squidward: Please tell me this isn't a joke.
SpongeBob: Go on, Mr. Krabs. Tell him. Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke. [Plankton walks over]
Plankton: As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking. [he points at SpongeBob] You work for me now, SpongeBob. [he whips out a bucket with the initials "CB" on it] Time to put on the official Chum Bucket bucket helmet. [he jumps onto SpongeBob's head, kicks off the Krusty Krew hat and puts the bucket on his head. SpongeBob screams and runs to Mr. Krabs while knocking Plankton and the bucket off his head]
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I don't wanna work for him! [he tugs at Krabs' shirt collar] I wanna work for you here at the Krusty Krab! [he and Krabs start crying loudly and hug]
Mr. Krabs: I'm sorry, boy! It's all my fault!
Plankton: [pretending to sound genuinely sad] What kind of cold, heartless person would break apart such a loving relationship? [whips out a crowbar] I would! [he jumps up and uses the crowbar to pry SpongeBob off Krabs. SpongeBob goes flying with Mr. Krabs' arms still clung to him]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! [he slams into a cage and Krabs' arms fly off him. Plankton walks over and shuts the door]
Plankton: This is your greatest blunder, Krabs. For fifteen years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up. I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula, but I've got the next best thing: the guy who makes 'em! [a propeller emerges from the cage] I'm gonna run you out of business, Krabs! [the propeller spins and pilots SpongeBob into the Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [he cries] Can I have my arms back? [Plankton walks over and throws the arms on Krabs' head. Cut to the cage hovering over a spotlight and dropping SpongeBob into it]
SpongeBob: What is this place? [the lights turn on and screens with wires and gizmos start starting up. SpongeBob gasps. A giant boiler turns on. SpongeBob yelps. A light turns on and a calendar entitled "Science!" appears and the photo of the month is some nerd in front of a blackboard. SpongeBob screams. Plankton bursts open the doors]
Plankton: Okay, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty! [he walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Actually, uh, Mr. Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh...
Plankton: Perhaps you don't understand. You work for me now [he jumps onto SpongeBob's knee] and as your new boss, I command you to make me a patty this instant, or I'll be forced to remove your brain and implant it in my robot chef! [we see a giant robot that bears a slight resemblance to SpongeBob] So get cooking. [he twangs SpongeBob's nose. Later, SpongeBob is in front of a weird looking grill. He picks up a spatula with a spring end. He puts his fingers to one of the holes in the grill and steam bursts from it. SpongeBob screams. He looks at a digital sign reading "KITCHEN"]
SpongeBob: The sign says "kitchen", but my heart says "jail".  A stove is a stove, no matter where you go. 
Mr. Krabs:  A patty is a patty, that's what I say. 
SpongeBob:  A grill is a grill, this is surely so, 
Mr. Krabs:  And fries should be fries, either way. 
SpongeBob:  But this grill is not a home. This is not the stove I know. 
Mr. Krabs:  I would trade it all away, if you'd come back to stay. 
Unison:  This kitchen's not the same without you. 
Mr. Krabs:  It's just a greasy spoon 
SpongeBob:  It's just a greasy spoon... 
Unison:  ...without you.  [SpongeBob cries]
Plankton: What is he doing? All these tears... and the showtunes... Why isn't he making the patties? Forget it. I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef.
Karen: You know that never works! The answer is obvious: to get to the SpongeBob, you must show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give you what you want.
Plankton: Will you be quiet? I'm thinking! I've got it! To get to the SpongeBob, I'll show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give me what I want.
[We see SpongeBob struggling to make a Krabby Patty with one of Plankton's cooking machines]
SpongeBob: [Sound of surprise]
Plankton: Hi!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!
Plankton: Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding.
SpongeBob: Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab.
Plankton: Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?
SpongeBob: Well, I usually cook on a grill.
Plankton: You got it! [Plankton brings a grill into the Chum Bucket] Well, it wasn't easy, but here it is! One old frying grill. How about we try it out?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way.
Plankton: Say no more, I'll take care of everything. [Plankton pushes the grill] How about here?
SpongeBob: A little more to the left.
Plankton: How's this, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Move it over a little more.
Plankton: Here?
SpongeBob: Keep going.
Plankton: Here?
SpongeBob: Almost! That's it, just a little more...perfect! Right there! I don't know, it still doesn't feel right.
Plankton: [cut to a blindfolded SpongeBob] Just a few more steps, SpongeBob. Okay, go ahead, take it off! [he removes the blindfold] It's an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen!
SpongeBob: It is an exact replica! Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing! One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr. Krabs! [his face turns sad. wailing] Oh...Mr. Krabs!
Plankton: Don't cry, SpongeBob! I'll show you it's much better working for me! Is there anything that old skinflint Krabs wouldn't let you have?
SpongeBob: Well...there is one thing I've always wanted... [cut to SpongeBob with some fancy vibrating shoes on] Wow!
Plankton: So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob: Well... [cut to SpongeBob in a bubble bath, licking green mint ice cream]
Plankton: You ready to make some patties?
SpongeBob: Wait ‘til I finish my ice cream! [cut to SpongeBob riding a toy car, with Plankton pushing him]
Plankton: [while pushing him] How about those patties?
SpongeBob: Faster! Faster! Faster! [cut to Plankton reading to SpongeBob a baby book]
Plankton: And then the littlest sea-elf said... [drool drops on Plankton. SpongeBob is sleeping. He wakes up] Huh? Steady, Plankton! It's all gonna pay off soon enough. Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?
SpongeBob: All this preparation is making me hungry.
Plankton: Me too. You know what would really hit the spot? Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob: Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos.
Plankton: [laughs] Good one, SpongeBob. But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?
SpongeBob: [yawning] No, I don't really feel like it!
Plankton: But I don't understand. [SpongeBob drinks soda from a cup] You have the grill, and the spatula, and the comfy chair. [loses his cool as he exposes his hands with fumes rising out] I rubbed your putrid feet!
SpongeBob: Tell you what, half-pint: why don't you ask me later!
Plankton: [growls in fury] I command you to make me a patty this instant!
SpongeBob: [crossing his arms in refusal] No!
Plankton: Don't back sass me!
SpongeBob: [mocking Plankton] Do ba da ma!
Plankton: What?! [SpongeBob blows a raspberry as he moons at him] That's it, mister! You just lost your brain privileges. [cut to Plankton outside of a lab] Finished! SpongeBob, come in here! Or should I say RobotBob Sponge...Chef...Pants... [to the audience] I put the brain in the robot, you know. [to Robot SpongeBob] You shouldn't have been a spoiled brat. You see, I always get what I want. And I want you to make me a Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob: [Beeping] Dee dee doodle dee dee doo. Response: Why don't you ask me later?
Plankton: [going mad] What? What?!
SpongeBob: Get welded.
Plankton: [pressing the button on the control] Wait! I command you make me a Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob: [Robot SpongeBob reads a comic and drinks oil] I don't wanna.
Plankton: [screams out of madness]
Mr. Krabs: [cut to the Krusty Krab] Well, old girl, this looks like our final chapter. [holds up an "Out of Business" sign] Huh?
Plankton: [crying] I can't take anymore. You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back! It's not worth it. I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square.
Mr. Krabs: Um...Well... [taking off the "Out of Business" sign off the doors] a deal's a deal, Plankton. He's your headache now.
Plankton: Oh, please, have mercy, Krabs! I'll do anything! I beg of you!
Mr. Krabs: How 'bout... you give me fifty bucks, and I'll take him off your hands.
Plankton: It's a deal! I cheated anyway.
Mr. Krabs: Now, be gone with you, you puny pest! [Mr. Krabs throws Plankton back inside the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: Thank you! [a crashing sound is heard] Ouch.
SpongeBob: My brain and I are glad to be back, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Glad to have you back, lad. Now get to those patties! The lunch rush is a-comin'!
SpongeBob: [Yawns] I don't feel like it! Why don't you ask me later, Krabby? [laughs; Mr. Krabs glares at him] I mean...I'm working all day for free! My treat! [runs to the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: That's what I thought you said.
[The exterior of the Krusty Krab is shown.]
Mr. Krabs: [Off-Screen] Da da dee. [Mr. Krabs is shown in his office. He is stitching.] Stitch one purl two. da da dee doo. [The scene shows that he is stitching a pattern of a dollar bill.] Da day dee da. Dee doh.. [He abruptly stops and sniffs the air.] What's that smell? [He runs over to the cashier boat.] The register! [He shakes the register and smells it.] $49.0... 8?! That's a penny short! [He starts crying.]
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, no. Not a penny. Help! Somebody, help us.
[SpongeBob slides up from the floor of the boat.]
SpongeBob: It's just a penny, sir. [Mr. Krabs stops crying. SpongeBob jumps out of the boat.] It doesn't matter.
Mr. Krabs: Doesn't matter? It's money that makes the world go round, boy! It's money that keeps your [He holds up a right-angled ruler to SpongeBob's pants.] pants square! It's money that keeps Squidward in frilly soap!
[The scene cuts to Squidward in the Dining area sniffing the air.]
Squidward: Lilac!
[The scene cuts to show the Krusty Krab with numerous large bandages on it.]
Mr. Krabs: It's money that paid for all them renovations we did! Oh, nothing in all the seven seas could matter more. Not even that... [Something catches his eye] Hmm? ...scrumptious, curvy cutie.
SpongeBob: I see her, Mr. Krabs. [The scene cuts to a Krabby Patty on a tray, next to a soda.] A Krabby Patty with cheese. [A pair of flippers grabs the sandwich. The scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs.] The classic.
Mr. Krabs: Not the sandwich, boy. The curvy cutie holding the sandwich.
[The scene cuts to Mrs. Puff eating the Krabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen] Hey! [On-Screen] that's my driving teacher, Mrs. Puff!
Mr. Krabs: Mrs. Puff? Aw, she's married.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. She's single.
Mr. Krabs: Then what happened to Mr. Puff?
[The scene cuts to Mr. Puff, who is now a lamp, being turned on. The scene cuts back to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: She doesn't like to talk about it.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what I wouldn't give to have a lass like that on me claw.
SpongeBob: Hey, I know! Why don't I take you over and introduce you?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no, I, I'm, I'm too old, boy. Too hard-shelled for love. Besides, I ain't not properly dressed.
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, Mr. Krabs! [The scene cuts to a close-up of his clothes, which are messy.] You look great. [The scene cuts back to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.] You wait here while I go break the ice.
[SpongeBob quickly runs off.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, no, wait! I'm too nervous! Ooh!
[It cuts to a wide shot of Mrs. Puff.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff.
[Mrs. Puff screams.]
Mrs. Puff: Hit the brakes, SpongeBob! Watch that tree! Left! Left!
SpongeBob: [He snaps his fingers.] Wait, Mrs. Puff! We're not driving.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't expect to see you here.
SpongeBob: I work here, Mrs. Puff. Want to meet my boss?
Mrs. Puff: Well, I'm not...
SpongeBob: Don't move!
[SpongeBob runs back to Mr. Krabs.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
SpongeBob: [While dragging Mr. Krabs to the table] Mrs. Puff, [The two stop.] I'd like to introduce you to Mr... [Mr. Krabs falls forward onto the floor. SpongeBob props him back up.] Mrs. Puff, I'd like to introduce you to my boss, Mr. Krabs.
Mrs. Puff: [Nervously] Uh, hello.
[Mr. Krabs quivers.]
SpongeBob: Psst! Mr. Krabs, say hello. [Mr. Krabs nervously mutters.] No, no, Mr. Krabs. Just say hello.
[Mr. Krabs performs a strangled groan.]
Mrs. Puff: Hmm, perhaps another time would be...
Mr. Krabs: [As Mrs. Puff is starting to leave, Mr. Krabs yelling at SpongeBob] No!
SpongeBob: Wait. [As Mrs. Puff sits back down and shivering] He's trying to tell you something.
Mrs. Puff: [Shivering] Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs jerks his eyes and moving his arms around weirdly, while speaking gibberish.] I don't understand.
[Mr. Krabs looks at SpongeBob and speaks gibberish to him.]
SpongeBob: [While Mr. Krabs is speaking gibberish] Oh! I think Mr. Krabs is saying that he'd like to... [Mr. Krabs stops speaking gibberish and turns around.] ...hit you with a rake!
Mrs. Puff: [Scared] Goodness!
Mr. Krabs: No!
[Mr. Krabs lifts his tall eyes up and down, while Speaking gibberish.]
SpongeBob: Try to guess your weight.
Mrs. Puff: [Offended] Well!
[Mr. Krabs flails his arms, while speaking gibberish.]
SpongeBob: [While Mr. Krabs is speaking gibberish] No, wait. He wants to take you... [thinks for a second] ...on a date!
[Mr. Krabs gasps happily and falls over]
Mrs. Puff: Is that true, Mr. Krabs? Do you want to take me on a date?
Mr. Krabs: Aye. What do you say?
Mrs. Puff: What do I say? [starts laughing] I say, you have a way with words, Mr. Krabs.
[Mrs. Puff walks away.]
Mr. Krabs: I still got it. [chuckles]
[The bubble transition goes to the exterior of the Krabs' house at night.]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen] Ready for your date, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [Off-screen] I'm always ready when it comes to datin', lad!
[The interior of the Krabs' Anchor is shown.]
SpongeBob: [While he is holding a list, and Mr. Krabs, who is wearing fancy clothes, walk down stairs] Breath spray?
Mr. Krabs: [sprays mouth with breath spray] Check.
SpongeBob: Lucky hanky?
Mr. Krabs: [He takes out his hanky.] Check.
SpongeBob: Giant rusty anchor?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, anchor. Anchor? I can't find me giant rusty anchor!
[SpongeBob throws the list away and laughs]
SpongeBob: Relax, Mr. Krabs. [While opening the door.] Just a little joke. [While making a circle in the air with his hands.] Good luck with you know who.
[SpongeBob moves his eyebrows up and down.]
Mr. Krabs: Who's that?
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah. Well, wish me luck, lad!
[The bubble transition goes to the exterior of Fancy!]
Mrs. Puff: [Off-Screen] Oh, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff are shown at a table inside.] This dinner has been so wonderful. The coral was cooked to perfection. [giggles. I don't think I could eat another bite.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I doubt that, my little shrimp boat.
[Mrs. Puff giggles.]
Mrs. Puff: You're spoiling me, Mr. Krabs. I mean, [The scene shows a squid rubbing Mrs. Puff's feet.] foot rubs between courses. [While pulling out a caricature of herself.] Caricatures. Imported music. [The scene swift pans to a live-action scuba diver plays the piano on the other side of the room. The scene shows Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Nothing's too good for you, my prickly peach.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, what I'm trying to tell you, Mr. Krabs, is...
Waiter: Uh, sir, your fancy pantsy limousine is here.
Mr. Krabs: Wonderful! Pufflily-poo, your chariot awaits!
Mrs. Puff: Well...
[Mr. Krabs whistles and two men join the waiter in carrying a screaming Mrs. Puff away.]
Mr. Krabs: You'll never have to walk again, my little lobster bib.
[He sighs as the waiter approaches him again.]
Waiter: Your bill, sir.
[Mr. Krabs takes the bill.]
Mr. Krabs: What? [it shows the bill] $100?! Well, this can't possibly be correct!
Waiter: Oh, my mistake, sir. Thank you for pointing that out. [he hands Mr. Krabs a different bill] This is your bill.
[Mr. Krabs takes the bill. Looks down and his eyes enlarge, oddly. The exterior of the restaurant is shown and the cork flies off. The scream shatters the glass bottle, which causes the sign to go flying and the valet fall over. The bubble transitions shows the Krabs' anchor at night. It then cuts to the interior and Mr. Krabs, who is back in his normal clothes, crying on the floor. SpongeBob is also there.]
SpongeBob: I don't understand, Mr. Krabs. How can you spend $100,000 in one night?
[Mr. Krabs gets up.]
Mr. Krabs: [Still crying] Oh, SpongeBob! I couldn't help but spend every cent I had on her! I couldn't control myself!
SpongeBob: What are you gonna do?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know, boy! I've got another date tomorrow! I'm caught in the middle of me two great loves! Sweet Mrs. Puff, and the rest of me money!
SpongeBob: [while Mr. Krabs is crying] I wish there was some way I could help.
[Mr. Krabs stops crying.]
Mr. Krabs: Perhaps there is, boy! [hands SpongeBob his wallet] I'm puttin' you in charge of me money.
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You come with me on the date and don't let me spend any money. [The bubble transition shows Mrs. Puff's house. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk up to it.] Now remember, we keep it cheap by going to the park. And no matter how much I ask you, you don't give me any of me money. Now give me a dollar.
SpongeBob: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Good boy! You'll do fine.
[Mr. Krabs knocks on the door.]
Mrs. Puff: [Off-screen; singingly] Who is it?
Mr. Krabs: It's me, [Mr. Krabs' pupils turn into hearts.] my beautiful bell buoy!
[Mrs. Puff is heard giggling.]
Mrs. Puff: Just a minute!
[Mr. Krabs pupils turn back to normal.]
Mr. Krabs: Flowers! Flowers, boy! Go get flowers!
SpongeBob: But you said...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't call on a classy lady like Mrs. Puff empty-handed. We ain't talking about this... [He makes a square in the air.] ...or this... [He makes a triangle in the air.] ...we're talking about this!
[Mr. Krabs makes the circle in the air.]
Mrs. Puff: [Off-screen] Almost ready.
Mr. Krabs: Hurry, boy! Get the flowers!
[SpongeBob runs off as Mrs. Puff opens her door.]
Mr. Krabs: Mrs. Puff. You're as beautiful as ever.
[Mrs. Puff sighs.]
Mrs. Puff: That's funny. I thought I heard SpongeBob's voice.
Mr. Krabs: Uh... you did. He'll be right back. He's our personal assistant for the day.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, e-excuse me. I have to call my insurance agent.
[Mrs. Puff hurries back inside]
Mr. Krabs: Of course, my beautiful Puff.
[Mr. Krabs sighs and his pupils turn to hearts again.]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen; making the heart pupils go away] Mr. Krabs, [While walking to give Mr. Krabs the flowers.] I got the flowers you wanted me to buy.
Mr. Krabs: [While turning around.] What's that?
SpongeBob: I got the flowers for Mrs. Puff.
Mr. Krabs: We had an agreement, boy. You ain't supposed to spend any of me money!
SpongeBob: But you said...
Mrs. Puff: [As Mr. Krabs' pupils turn to hearts again] Here I come!
Mr. Krabs: [while Mrs. Puff opens the door and he grabs the flowers] For you, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Oh, [as she is grabbing the flowers] flowers. Oh, how thoughtful!
Mr. Krabs: [While he holds out an empty claw] And here's a box of chocolates. [He turns back to SpongeBob.] SpongeBob, where's the chocolates?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, the budget doesn't allow for...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't go to Mrs. Puff's house without chocolates. Hurry! Hurry!
[SpongeBob runs off. SpongeBob comes back with the heart-shaped box of chocolates]
SpongeBob: [As Mr. Krabs' pupil return to normal] I bought the biggest box they had!
Mr. Krabs: Buy, buy, buy! Spend, spend, spend! Is that all you can think about?!
Mrs. Puff: [As Mr. Krabs' pupils turn back into hearts] Oh, Eugene!
Mr. Krabs: [As he offer Mrs. Puff the box of chocolates] Here's those chocolates I bought for you. What are we doing today, Mrs. Puff? Dinner? Dancing? A trip to the moon?
SpongeBob: [while Mr. Krabs' eyes turn back to normal] Psst, Mr. Krabs, we're just going for a walk in the park, remember?
Mrs. Puff: Actually, a walk in the park sounds perfect. It's a beautiful day. I'll just need to get a sun hat and...
Mr. Krabs: [While his pupils turn back into hearts] Mrs. Puff needs a sun hat, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh, I think she...
Mr. Krabs: The sun is beatin' down on poor Mrs. Puff's head.
SpongeBob: As your financial advisor, I suggest...
Mr. Krabs: [his eyes are back to normal] There's no time for suggestions! Go buy a hat!
[SpongeBob starts to leave, but comes back.]
SpongeBob: But...
Mr. Krabs: Today! [SpongeBob runs off and Mrs. Puff puts her fins over her mouth.] Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! I'll [He takes out a barrel.] shade ya! [He places the barrel on Mrs. Puff's head.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, hurry!
SpongeBob: [as he comes back from the store with a large straw hat] One shady hat.
Mr. Krabs: Good job, lad.
[Mr. Krabs puts the hat on Mrs. Puff.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, well, thank you, but you didn't need to buy one. I have a hat in the closet.
Mr. Krabs: Didn't need to buy one? [He turns his head around like an owl to face SpongeBob, still grinning] You hear that, boy? [in high pitch] We didn't need to buy a hat. [angrily] Aren't you supposed to be saving me money?!
SpongeBob: I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! But you keep telling me to buy things for Mrs. Puff! It's all really confusing.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm sorry. This is my fault. I'm not thinking clearly. I'm making a sailor's promise, boy. From this moment on, I won't ask you to buy anything for Mrs. Puff!
Narrator: A few moments later...
Mr. Krabs: [happily as hearts float in the background] SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff needs a new fur coat! [After SpongeBob buys one, Krabs is mad and flaming dollars float in the background]
Mr. Krabs: You're spending all me money! [happily] Puffy needs a new pair of shoes! [SpongeBob gets the shoes]
Mr. Krabs: [angrily] You're breaking me, boy! [happily] She needs fine jewelry! [SpongeBob gets the jewelry] Not that fine! [SpongeBob runs back and forth, speeding up, carrying various items as Mr. Krabs keeps yelling his name. He eventually becomes too tired to move] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a pink umbrella] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a bicycle] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a purple surfboard] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a grandfather clock] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with an anchor barbell] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a TV] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back and forth with lots of presents] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
[his voice echoes, and SpongeBob is seen sitting on the ground, his arms stretched, and he is panting]
Mr. Krabs: [runs up, his eyes are shaped like hearts] SpongeBob! I'm glad I caught you. I want you to buy Mrs. Puff...
SpongeBob: Wait! Don't tell me. You want me to run down to the store and buy Mrs. Puff something she doesn't need! Then you want me to run back here so you can say, [stretches out his eyeballs, imitating Mr. Krabs] "Arrgh, SpongeBob! You're spending all me money!" And then I'll say, "But Mr. Krabs, I'm only doing what you said!" Then you'll say, "We're not talking about this..." [Makes the triangle] ..."Or this"... [Makes the square] ..."we're talking about this!" [He squiggles all over the screen. The screen fades out for a moment. Fades back in to see SpongeBob panting with Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: But, lad, this time's different! Mrs. Puff needs this! [Cut to Mrs. Puff who has many unneeded, expensive items surrounding her]
Mrs. Puff: Are we going to the park soon?
Mr. Krabs: Please, lad, I'm begging you! I'm a lonely old crustacean who's found love! Don't let me lose her! [Starts to cry]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, don't. Don't cry, Mr. Krabs! Come on. Okay, I, I'm going to get it, see? [Walks offscreen, and comes back with a washing machine] Cheer up, Mr. Krabs, Here's that washing machine you wanted.
Mr. Krabs: Cheer up? How can I cheer up... when you're spending all me hard-earned cash?!
SpongeBob: See?! You just did it again!
Mr. Krabs: Lad, I can't help it if you're loose with other people's money. [SpongeBob gets a blank expression on his face] Do you think Mrs. Puff will need a dryer to go along with that?
SpongeBob: Well, Mr. Krabs. Do you want to know what I think? [screams] Arrgh! Regga flebba breeka brecka smullen-ellen Mr. Krabs! Yegga hegga mergin wallet! Dimmy middy spend! Rivy flivy diva shiva Mr. Krabs Wallet! [During SpongeBob's rage, Mrs. Puff looks up these words in the dictionary that Mr. Krabs bought her, and gasps and blushes. SpongeBob angrily walks past Mrs. Puff while muttering, and Mr. Krabs' mouth is agape]
Mrs. Puff: I didn't know SpongeBob had such a colorful vocabulary. Actually, there's something I'd like to say, too, Mr. Krabs. [Takes off her fur coat, shoes and hat] I'm afraid I just don't feel comfortable accepting all these gifts. I'd rather go Dutch, if you don't mind. [Hands him some money from her purse]
Mr. Krabs: Uh, okay.
Mrs. Puff: You're a very sweet man, Mr. Krabs. [Mrs. Puff kisses him and his eyes bend into the shape of a heart]
Mr. Krabs: [as his eyes make a heart] Aawww...
French Narrator: Ahh, another peaceful evening in Bikini Bottom. Listen to the tropical tranquility. [we see the town of Bikini Bottom; something underground is tunneling and consumes the Bikini Bottom sign] Uh-oh. [the tunneling thing moves on to the rest of Bikini Bottom; a cop is writing a ticket for a car parked near a fire hydrant; the thing, still invisible, makes eating noises; we then see that the car has disappeared, so the cop picks up the fire hydrant, moves it to the adjacent car, and places the ticket on that car, whistling as he casually walks away; the thing moves on to SpongeBob's house; Gary wakes up, sees the thing, and meows in terror; SpongeBob is still fast asleep]
SpongeBob: [mumbling, half-asleep] Two soups, please. Thank you. [the thing takes SpongeBob's blanket] You keep the change. [the thing takes SpongeBob's pillow] What? [he wakes up fully and stares fixedly at the thing in terror; camera zooms out to show half of the pineapple house's walls missing; a new scene shows SpongeBob talking to the crowd at the Krusty Krab] I saw it! It was big! It was all wiggly! And it ate everything!
Patrick: That's horrible! [gobbles down a whole tray of food, containers and all]
SpongeBob: It was an Alaskan... Bull... Worm! [each of the three words appears on screen; "Alaskan" in an icy form, "Bull" in a furry text, and "Worm!" with different worms forming the word. The crowd murmurs worriedly]
Fred: He ate my wheelbarrow! [he has his wheelbarrow with a bite taken out of it]
Nancy Suzy Fish: He ate my children's homework! [her two kids wink simultaneously and give a big thumbs-up]
Awesome Fish/Fish 3: [has a huge bite taken out of his butt] Do I need to say it?
Fish 4: [crowd murmurs some more] How can we protect ourselves?
Mr. Krabs: I've got it! Let's all buy a Krabby Patty! [crowd boos and throws ketchup and mustard bottles at him]
Fish 5: We should lock our doors!
Mable: We should call my nephew!
Knight Fish: We should dig a moat!
Patrick: We should take Bikini Bottom, and push it somewhere else! [crowd immediately quiets down]
Squidward: That idea may just be crazy enough... to get us all killed! [crowd resumes fretting]
Patrick: [Amongst the murmuring] What's wrong with my idea?
Fish 1: Let's get someone to go after it!
Mr. Krabs: There ain't no one fool enough to take on an Alaskan Bull Worm! [a horrible screeching noise is heard; the crowd cringes; we see a scary-looking old guy in a raincoat with a hook for a hand, scraping it on the window of the Krusty Krab; he stops]
Unnamed Sailor: You got a bathroom in this place?
Mr. Krabs: [looks slightly peeved] In the back.
Unnamed Sailor: [legs wobble] Thanks. [he runs for it]
Sandy: [under a wide-brimmed cowboy hat] I'll catch your worm for ya, that is, if you're willing to pay! [tips brim up]
Mr. Krabs: No! You'll never get a cent out of me! [runs to block the cash register with his body] Never! I'd rather that worm come in here right now and eat you all alive! [begins foaming at the mouth; the crowd looks at him strangely; he calms down] Sorry.
Sandy: [laughs good-naturedly] Aw, shucks. I don't want your money. I was just playing up the drama of the moment, is all. [Mr. Krabs chuckles, which gradually turns into crying; Sandy continues] Nope. I'm not gonna take that spineless critter down for nothing, 'cause this is personal. Look. My tail's gone! [she shows them; crowd gasps] Varmint must've got it while I had my back turned, the coward! [crowd sympathizes] I am gonna get back what's mine! [crowd cheers]
SpongeBob: [looks alarmed] What? But, Sandy, you don't know what you're up against. We're talking about an Alaskan... Bull... Worm! [the three words appear on screen again]
Sandy: Well, I don't know nothing about Alaska, but looky here. [she pulls out a wallet with pictures] Back in Texas I wrangled bulls, and I wrangled worms. [we see pictures of a real-life squirrel with a lasso around a bull, then a lasso around a worm] Far as I'm concerned, doing 'em both together just saves rope. Now I'm gonna go kick me some worm tail! Yee-haw! [she runs to the doors of the Krusty Krab; the crowd goes wild]
SpongeBob: But, Sandy, you don't know!
Sandy: Don't worry, SpongeBob. I won't be long. [leaves]
SpongeBob: [chases after her] Sandy! Sandy!
Mr. Krabs: [amidst the still-cheering crowd] Go get 'em, Sandy! We have the utmost confidence in you! [crowd stops; Mr. Krabs turns to Patrick] Now, what was that idea of yours? [scene cuts to all the citizens trying to push the buildings of Bikini Bottom]
Patrick: PUSH! [citizens strain as they try to push the town; cut back to SpongeBob chasing after Sandy]
SpongeBob: Wait! Sandy!
Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob, you coming to watch?
SpongeBob: Sandy, don't go!
Sandy: Why not?
SpongeBob: Sandy, I saw it! It's big... scary... and pink! [each word appears on the screen; "Big" displayed in large text, "Scary" in green drippy text, and "Pink" in a girly pink text]
Sandy: So's Patrick's belly button, but I ain't afraid of that neither!
SpongeBob: You'll get massacred! [collapses into sponge-cubes]
Sandy: SpongeBob, I'm from Texas. What you think is big and what I think is big are two totally different "big"s. Besides, he's got my tail. I can't take that sitting down.
SpongeBob: Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail?
Sandy: If that worm ain't got my tail, who does?
SpongeBob: [unconvincingly] Um, I do?
Sandy: You do? Where?
SpongeBob: Um... in my pocket.
Sandy: Well, why didn't you just say so? Give it here! Come on! [SpongeBob looks nervous, pulls something from his pocket, and opens his hand] SpongeBob, that's a paper clip and a piece of string.
SpongeBob: [shakes head, meekly] No, it's not. This is your tail.
Sandy: [annoyed] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [defensively] How would you know?! It's always behind you! Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go! [he jumps onto the front of Sandy's air helmet and hugs it]
Sandy: [pulls him off] SpongeBob, what is the matter with you? Now, I'm gonna go give that legless rascal what-for, and there ain't nothing you can say to stop me! [resumes walking]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? What if I said... 'blargen-fezibble-nukhip'?
Sandy: [stops] Well, I gotta admit, that's slowin' me down, but I'm still going for him! [continues]
SpongeBob: [appears next to Sandy as she strides along] You know, tails are so overrated. Let's just forget about it and go home. [Sandy keeps walking; SpongeBob reappears] I've got ice cream! With nuts... [Sandy continues; SpongeBob appears once more, this time with a goofy squirrel mask on his face] Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm! Y'all come back here, young lady!
Sandy: You ain't my pa!
SpongeBob: [stands in front of her with boxing gloves] Sandy, if you want to get to that worm, you're gonna have to go through me! [Sandy pushes through his body as if walking through a pair of swinging doors; he grabs her ankles, crying] Sandy, no! I can't let you! I'm not gonna let you get killed. If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure!
Sandy: Ain't no way some dumb old sea worm's gonna make a meal of me. I'm too Texas tough!
SpongeBob: [still crying and holding onto her ankles] No, not tough enough. Not tough enough!
Sandy: SpongeBob, quit your worrying. I can take care of myself. After all, who's the strongest critter in Bikini Bottom? [she grabs an anchor and pulls a boat down from the surface]
SpongeBob: You are.
Sandy: And who put the hi-yah, hi, ho, "K" in karate? [makes a K shape]
SpongeBob: [shaped like a U] You did.
Sandy: And who saves your yellow backside from certain destruction on a regular basis?
SpongeBob: [his butt has "Property of Sandy Cheeks" printed on it, states it meekly] You do.
Sandy: Right. And I can handle your little bull worm too, 'cause I am the best there is! There ain't nothin' too big or too ornery for me to catch.
SpongeBob: Okay.
Sandy: Say it.
SpongeBob: There isn't anything...
Sandy: Ain't nothin'!
SpongeBob: [in a high-pitched voice like Sandy] Ain't nothin' [normal voice] too big or too ornery for you to catch. But... [Sandy cuts him off] But... [cuts him off again] And... [cuts him off again] We... [cuts him off again] I... [cuts him off again] Yeah but...
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: You see...
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: I... [Sandy cuts him off one last time with a frustrated groan]
Sandy: [picks up some sand from the ground as if tracking an animal and sniffs it] Worm sign. [she holds a small sign in her palm that has "WORM" painted on it; looks up] He's in that cave.
SpongeBob: Sandy, are you sure you...?
Sandy: Course I am! I'm going in, and I ain't coming out 'til I got me a big heaping plate of worm stew. [she walks into the cave; SpongeBob hides behind a rock and shudders; we hear Sandy inside the cave] Aha! There you are, you tail-nabbin' varmint! Hi-yah! [we hear karate noises; Sandy peeks out of the cave] I'm winnin', SpongeBob! [resumes fighting]
SpongeBob: Sandy, that's not...! [more fighting noises; Sandy peeks out again]
Sandy: This shouldn't take long. [resumes fighting]
SpongeBob: Sandy, that's not...!
Sandy: Almost done!
SpongeBob: Sandy!
Sandy: Yee-haw! [comes out riding a pink segmented thing] I got him, SpongeBob! [makes a giant knot and stands on it proudly]
SpongeBob: [still uneasy] Sandy...?
Sandy: Boy, howdy. This critter put up some sort of fight. But I'm from Texas, and as you can see, no worm is a match for me. I even found my tail! [we see that she has tied the fur to the small remainder of her tail]
SpongeBob: That's not the worm.
Sandy: [looking annoyed with her arms crossed] Pardon?
SpongeBob: That's not the worm. That's his tongue. [camera zooms out to show that SpongeBob is right; the opening of the cave is actually the worm's open mouth; his eyes make a squishy blinking noise]
Sandy: Ohhhh. This is the tongue, and... the whole thing... is the... worm. [freaks out] RUN FOR YOUR LIIIIIIFE!!!! [they sprint away; the worm chomps down, roars angrily, and chases after them]
SpongeBob: So what's the plan, Sandy? [they look back and see that the worm is approaching faster]
Sandy: Run faster!
SpongeBob: I could've thought of that. Hey, wait a minute! I was right, wasn't I?!
Sandy: Later!
SpongeBob: Ah, he is too big for you, isn't he?
Sandy: Not now, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I wanna hear you say it!
Sandy: Can we talk about this another time?
SpongeBob: Say it!
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Say it, or I'll trip you! [he continues running on one foot, the other poised to trip Sandy]
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: Say it!
Sandy: Not now!
SpongeBob: Say it!
Sandy: Okay! You were right, and I was wrong. I was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Are you happy now?
SpongeBob: [smiles triumphantly] I knew it. [the worm emits another huge growl; prompting the two to run even faster; they run up and down a sand mound, which the worm plows right through; they run past Fish 3, who is leaning over under his car's hood; his butt is bandaged up; the worm passes by and takes another bite out of him]
Fish 3: Not again!
SpongeBob: Uh, Sandy?
Sandy: Yeah?
SpongeBob: What do we do now?
Sandy: [is panting and sweating; the worm growls again; Sandy sees the seemingly endless coral trees in front of them] I've got it! SpongeBob, you still got that paper clip and that string?
SpongeBob: I'm way ahead of you, Sandy. [fashions a necklace out of them] Look, it's a necklace! S for "SpongeBob" or S for "Sandy"! That way they can identify our bodies.
Sandy: No, silly! How about S for "save our skins"? [she takes the string and uses the hook of the paper clip to wrap the string around one of the coral trees; she grabs SpongeBob and swings them up and over the branch onto the worm's back] Yee-haw! Now this is what I call a rodeo! We'll be nice and safe up here. [the worm starts to plow off a cliff like a runaway train; Sandy and SpongeBob realize this, scream, and begin running toward the end of worm to the safety of the plateau; they jump off safely as the worm falls off the cliff] We did it!
SpongeBob: Yay! He'll never get out of there!
Sandy: We saved the town!
SpongeBob: Yay! Let's go tell everybody! [they leave the scene and new scene shows all the citizens still trying to push Bikini Bottom to safety; the city is now in the valley at the bottom of the cliff]
Patrick: Push! [citizens push the city] Push! [push one last time]
Citizens: Hooray! [the worm lands on the city and crushes it]
Worm: Ouuuuuch...
SpongeBob: See anything yet, Patrick?
Patrick: I need my glasses. [puts two glasses of water on his eyes like binoculars, which are real human eyes.] Hmmm... [a mail truck approaches] ...it's the mail truck!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Our package! [Patrick throws the glasses and they both start dancing and hopping]
Squidward: I didn't realize it was Happy Hopping Moron Day.
Norton: SpongeBob SquarePants?
SpongeBob: That's me! [Norton throws a big box next to him and Patrick]
Squidward: That's a big box!
SpongeBob: Thank you! [still dancing and hopping]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, when do we stop hopping?
SpongeBob: Thirty more seconds, Patrick. [rubs hands together]
Squidward: They probably ordered a lifetime supply of bubble soap. [laughs as SpongeBob and Patrick lift up a big-screen TV out of the box] Huh? A brand-new television?
SpongeBob: Easy... easy... [both him and Patrick throw the TV onto a trash-can]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah! [jump into the box and close the flaps]
Squidward: Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider. [walks up to the box with SpongeBob and Patrick inside] Let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box?
SpongeBob: [as he emerges from the box] Pretty smart, huh?
Patrick: [emerges from the box] I thought it wouldn't work.
Squidward: Uh-huh, that's quite a plan there. Oh, but wait, there was something else I wanted to ask you two. Now what was it? Oh, yeah, yeah. [yells in SpongeBob and Patrick's faces] Don't you two have any brains?!
SpongeBob: Squidward, we don't need a television. Not as long as we have our... [makes a rainbow over his head with his hands] ...imagination!
Squidward: Wow, I never thought of it that way. That's really something. Can I have your TV?
SpongeBob: With... [SpongeBob jumps on the flap of the box, makes another rainbow with his hands] ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate! [curls his finger in a hook shape] Arrrrr! A football player! [stands in a football player stance] Hup!
Patrick: A starfish!
Squidward: Patrick, you're already a starfish.
Patrick: See, Squidward? It works! You try!
Squidward: [rubs his two tentacles on both sides of his head] Okay, let's see. I'm imaging myself watching TV... [points to the one on the trash-can] ...and there it is! Can I have it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Sure, Squidward.
Squidward: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! [Squidward runs to the TV and pushes it to his house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, but if you change your mind, we'll be in this box!
Patrick: Let's play Mountain Climbing Adventure!
SpongeBob: Let's go for it! [pulls the flaps of the box over on them] Gloves!
Patrick: Check.
SpongeBob: Hats!
Patrick: Check.
SpongeBob: Underwear!
Patrick: Uh... check!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, climb up there and secure this rope.
Patrick: You got it! [climbing noises come from the box]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, you're going too high!
Squidward: I hope they put some air holes in that box. [goes inside his house]
SpongeBob: Take it easy, Patrick, you've got to acclimate!
Patrick: I'll take it easy when I'm dead! I'm shaking hands with Neptune! Whoo! Excelsior!
Squidward: [opens his door] Now where's that remote? [walks up to the remote, which is right next to the box. He picks it up, puts it in his shirt and stands next to the box, listening to SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick: I am the lizard king! Whoo!
SpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! I think we should keep our voices down! We might start an avalanche!
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: I said, I think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches!
Patrick: What should we keep down?
Squidward: Morons.
SpongeBob: Our voices!
Squidward: Will you two shut up?! [kicks the box, causing the sound of an avalanche, making SpongeBob and Patrick scream and fall, they both start to cry. Squidward is shocked] Sponge... Bob? [he softly touches the box, causing another avalanche]
Patrick: Hold me.
SpongeBob: Hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way!
Patrick: SpongeBob! My legs are frozen solid! You're going to have to cut them off with a saw! [Squidward begins to sweat]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I can't do that!
Patrick: Why not?
SpongeBob: Because I already cut off my own arms! [Squidward kneels down]
Patrick: Nooooo!
[Squidward quickly opens the box and looks in. SpongeBob and Patrick sit inside the box]
Squidward: [confused] What the? How were you two making that noise?
SpongeBob: [laughs] What noise, Squidward?
Patrick: I could only hear the sound of our laughter.
Squidward: Yes! But those sound effects: the avalanche, the, the, the...
Patrick: Don't forget the second avalanche.
Squidward: Forget it. [closes the box] I don't know why I'm wasting my time out here when I could be watching my brand new television. [helicopter sounds are heard from the box, Squidward looks around at the sky and ducks]
Pilot Inside Box: Attention climbers, please hold on! The saws are on the way!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
Squidward: Grrrr... Aha! [he opens the box again and sees SpongeBob and Patrick sitting inside the box again] How are you two doing that?
SpongeBob: First we establish a base camp at 15,000 feet...
Squidward: The noises! How are you two making those noises?
Patrick: That's easy. All you need is a box.
SpongeBob: And... [makes another rainbow with his hands] ...imagination.
Squidward: [as SpongeBob and Patrick duck down into the box] Are you trying to say that I have no imagination? I have more imagination... [tries to make a rainbow with his hands, like SpongeBob, but is unsuccessful] ...in one tentacle than you two have in your whole bodies.
Patrick: That's good. Now all you need is a box. [closes the box]
Squidward: [walks back to his house] I'll show them! [looks in his closet] There's got to be one in here! [finds a small, round green box] Ah! This hat box should do nicely. [pulls out a Mexican sombrero] Why haven't I worn this yet? [throws it off-screen, gets in the box but he is too big for it and then just sits there. He then frowns, looks at his watch and then gets mad and kicks the box. Police sirens are heard]
Policeman Inside SpongeBob and Patrick's box: Attention! We have you surrounded! Come out with your hands up!
Squidward: What do they want with me? What did I do? [he gasps] I must've violated some new box law! [walks out of his house showing the green box] Look officers, everything's okay. I won't do it again!
Criminal Inside Box: You'll never take me alive, coppers!
Man Inside Box: No, Johnny! Don't do it! [Police sirens are heard. Squidward gets angry and kicks his green box toward SpongeBob and Patrick's box]
Patrick: [opens box and sirens stop] Whoopee! Another box! [Patrick takes the hat box and closes the box they're sitting in and police sirens are heard again]
Squidward: I got to try to relax. Perhaps I can drown out their childish games with a little TV. [turns on TV to see a show with boxes on a conveyor belt in a factory]
Male TV narrator: It is here that the boxes reach their final stage of assembly. [changes channel to an old professor talking about a box equation on a chalkboard]
Professor: The equation is demonstrated here by this box. [changes channel to a soap opera with a man and woman]
Man: I couldn't afford a present this year, so I got you this box. [he holds up a box]
Woman: That's what I got you! [she also holds up a box]
Squidward: Isn't there anything on that isn't about boxes?! [changes channel to a boxing match on TV]
Announcer: And welcome back to Championship Boxing.
Squidward: [chuckles in hope] Heh-heh, I guess this is okay. I mean, it's not really about boxes. [two boxes go at each other in the ring] I give up.
Astronaut Inside SpongeBob and Patrick's Box: 3... 2... 1... blast off! [a loud rocket takes off noises are heard from the box]
Squidward: [fascinated] How are they doing that? That was the most realistic space launch I ever heard! There must be an explanation. Think, Squidward, think! [he imagines SpongeBob and Patrick playing a tape recorder with real rocket sound effects]
SpongeBob: Squidward's such a jerk. [both laugh]
Squidward: Laugh at me, will they? [opens box once again] All right, where is it?
Patrick: [comes out of Squidward's green hat box] Here I am!
SpongeBob: Where's what, Squidward?
Squidward: Don't "Where's what, Squidward?" me! Where's the tape recorder?
SpongeBob: We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!
Squidward: Don't "We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!" me!
SpongeBob: But we don't!
Patrick: [holds up a small, white, rectangular box in his hand] We have a tape recorder box.
Squidward: [takes the small, white box from Patrick and throws it offscreen] All right, make way you two, I'm coming in. [gets into box]
SpongeBob: Welcome aboard, Squidward! You've just set sail on the S.S... [makes a rainbow with his hands once more] ...Imagination... where our only destination is fantastic adventure! Where do you want to go first?
Squidward: No, no. Don't mind me, I'm just here to observe.
SpongeBob: Squidward, don't you see? Waiting and watching? That's not what the box is all about! It's about... [makes one last rainbow with his hands] ...imagination.
Squidward: All right, fine! [as he makes the rainbow go away with his hands] Take me to Robot Pirate Island! I wanna arm-wrestle with cowboys on the moon! Just do it so I can get back and watch TV!
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward! Robot Pirate Island it is! [SpongeBob and Patrick close their eyes and make pirate and robot sounds]
Patrick: [imitates robot] Beep-beep-beep.
SpongeBob: [imitates pirate] Arr.
Patrick: Beep-boop-bee-boop.
SpongeBob: Ahoy matey!
Patrick: Beep-beep.
SpongeBob: For that you'll walk the plank! [SpongeBob giggles softly, and Patrick starts chuckling goofily]
Squidward: [he gets angry. he growls] Why won't this thing turn on?! [he slams the bottom of the box with his fists] All right, fine. If you don't want to show me, [gets out of the box] I don't care! I've got better things to do than pace the floor wondering how you two work this thing. [Squidward paces back and forth in his house] How do those two work that thing? There's got to be a secret button or a switch or something! I mean, listen to that! [he hears real robot/pirate battle noises from box] Now, that sounds like Robot Pirate Island! Think, Squidward, think! I got it: when those two go to bed, I'll sneak in there and find that button! I'll wait all night if I have to! [he sits in his chair until nighttime]
[firework and cheering sounds are heard coming from the box. Patrick and SpongeBob come out of the box and Patrick yawns] I need sleep to refuel my imagination tanks!
SpongeBob: [Squidward looks out of his window] I still can't believe those pirates beat all those robots.
Patrick: Yeah, see you in the morning.
SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick. [they both go into their houses]
[Squidward sneaks out of his house. He tiptoes over to the box and gets inside]
Squidward: [He chuckles mischievously and then sees a piece of paper on the side of the box] Hello, what's this? [reads] "This plaque is to commemorate the brave pirates who gave their lives to keep this box safe from the Robot Menace. Lest we forget... Ohh! [tears paper into pieces with anger] I've got to find that button quick! [looks around the box] It's got to be around here somewhere. I don't see anything! It's just an empty box! Maybe it really was their imagination. Oh... get it together, Squidward! What are you saying? I mean, do I really believe that if I sit here and pretend to drive a race car that I'm suddenly going to start hearing noises? [pushes his foot down and the sound of an engine revving is heard] What the...? [Squidward turns the imaginary key] It actually works! I can't believe it! Ha-ha! Oh boy! This beats TV by a long shot! [laughs] Whooo-hoo-hoo! This is the most fun I've ever had! [the noises actually come from a garbage truck, which lifts the box into the other garbage]
SpongeBob: [Squidward cheering in the distance while SpongeBob is reading a book in bed with his bed posts lit like candles] Listen to that, Gary. Squidward finally made the box work after all. That's so great.
Squidward: [the garbage truck begins to drive away with the box that Squidward is in] Vroom! Vroom! Only two more laps to the finish line! [the garbage truck dumps out the trash, including the box] I'm in the lead! Out of my way! I'm almost there! [laughs as the box slides down a trash pile] Whoo-hoo-hoo! Victory is mine! [the box hits something, sending Squidward tumbling down, face first onto a cherry pie. He groans and the box falls on him. The next morning, SpongeBob and Patrick come out of their houses]
SpongeBob: Hey, our box is gone!
Patrick: Oh, well.
SpongeBob: I know! Let's go see Squidward!
Patrick: I hope he's not too down in the dumps today. [he and SpongeBob walk to Squidward's house and a timpani noise is heard in the background as the screen fades to black]
Narrator: Ah, Goo Lagoon, a luxurious oasis of sand and sea. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Sandy next to a tent]
Sandy: Shee-oot, SpongeBob. How are we gonna go swimmin' when you're in a shirt and tie?
SpongeBob: Ah, yes. How foolish of me. [cackles] Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit. [goes into the tent, then pokes his head out] And I won't do anything else. [goes back in]
Sandy: SpongeBob's actin' jumpier than a rattlesnake in a pickle barrel. Wait... what?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, I'll be changing, alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah! [puts on his headgear that was in the bag] Hi-yah! [puts on his karate gloves that was in the bag] Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah! [kicks the bag]
Sandy: SpongeBob, are you ready?
SpongeBob: Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready! [softly] Ready to get it on. [jumps out of the tent towards Sandy] Hi...
Sandy: Hi-yah! [kicks SpongeBob in his mouth] Look, SpongeBob, we both brought our karate gear.
SpongeBob: [muffled laughter] Great minds think alike, I suppose.
Sandy: Hi-yah! [karate chops him into the air. SpongeBob crashes into the ground, followed by his pants, socks, and shoes. He stands up with the clothing on his head and feet in some food]
SpongeBob: I may be down, but I'm not out! [looks down at his feet, which are in some potato salad at a family picnic]
Tom: Way to go, buddy. It took us three days to make that potato salad. [SpongeBob jumps away] Three days!
SpongeBob: [jumps into an empty area] Hi-yah! Sandy?
Sandy: Oh, I'm Sandy, alright. [her arms come out of the ground and squish SpongeBob's face] I'm very Sandy. [kicks SpongeBob into the air] Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: Oh, I get it. She's "Sandy." That's her name; she's also covered in... yes! [flies out of the water then back into it. Scene cuts to Sandy talking to an ice cream vendor]
Sandy: Back in Texas, we call ice cream "frozen cow juice". Excuse me for a sec. Hi-yah! [slaps SpongeBob in the face with her karate glove] Thank you.
Ice Cream Vendor: No, no, thank you.
Sandy: Hi-yah! [slaps SpongeBob again, sending him into the air and flying into a strong fish that is waiting in line]
Tough Fish #1: [growls] Who threw that piece of paper at me? [SpongeBob stammers and whistles]
Sandy: Hey, what's everybody waitin' in line for?
Tough Fish #1: Ahoy, fair lass, it be the line to get into the Salty Spitoon — [points over to an old building] the roughest, toughest sailor club ever to be built under the seven seas. Only the baddest of the bad can get in. You need to have muscles. [flexes his arm] You need to have muscles on your muscles. [flexes, even more, created more muscles on his previous ones] You need to have muscles on your eyeballs! [flexes his eyes, creating muscles]
SpongeBob: Ew. [a fish is screaming while flying out of the Salty Spitoon]
Sandy: Looks like a rip-snortin' good time, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yeah, let's go in.
Reg: [lets a fish walk in] Go ahead. [line moves up] Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
Tough Fish #1: How tough am I? How tough am I?! I had a bowl of nails for breakfast this morning!
Reg: Yeah, so?
Tough Fish #1: Without any milk.
Reg: Uhh, right this way, sorry to keep you waiting. [tough fish walks in. Sandy walks up to Reg] Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
Sandy: How tough am I? [rips off one of his tattoos that says "MOM" and puts it upside down back where it was. Reg screams in pain when Sandy rips off the tattoo]
SpongeBob: Wow.
Sandy: Got any more tattoos? [Reg covers the upside down tattoo with his arms]
Reg: Uhh, that won't be necessary. Go ahead.
Sandy: Thanks. See ya inside, SpongeBob! [walks in]
Reg: How tough are ya?
SpongeBob: How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup?
Reg: Sure. [hands the bottle of ketchup to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: It's on! [strains to open it, but he can't] If I could just run this under some hot water...
Reg: Get outta here. This place is too tough for you, little man.
SpongeBob: Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes.
Reg: Listen, kid. I think you'd be more comfortable over at that place. [points to the building across the street]
SpongeBob: Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong in Weenie Hut Jr's?
Reg: Uhh. Oh, no, sorry, I was actually pointing at the place next to it. [points to another building]
SpongeBob: Super Weenie Hut Jr's?
Reg: Yeah. Unless you think you're tough enough to fight me. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob sitting in a seat at Weenie Hut Jr's]
Nerd #1: How's your collection coming along?
Nerd #2: Well, I don't mean to brag, but it's pretty sweet. I'm in the process of acquiring issue 347 which will give me my fourth complete set.
Nerd #1: No...
SpongeBob: [snorts] What weenies. Oh, brother.
Robot: [robotic voice] Would you care for another diet cola with a lemon twist, weenie?
SpongeBob: What? But I'm not a weenie! [the robot scans SpongeBob with one of its scanners]
Robot: I'm sorry, sir, but my sensors indicate that you are indeed a weenie. [computer beeps and shows a picture of a hot dog weenie with the word "YES" below it]
SpongeBob: That's impossible! [the two nerds look at him. He runs off]
Robot: You can't hide what's inside.
SpongeBob: [runs over to Reg] I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie! [a strong, orange fish walks up]
Tough Fish #4: Hey, Reg, how's it going? [SpongeBob screams in surprise and he jumps onto Reg's arms.]
Reg: You were sayin'? [to orange fish] Go ahead, buddy.
Tough Fish #4: Thanks, Reg. [walks in]
SpongeBob: So, your name's Reg?
Reg: [throws SpongeBob aside] Would you get outta here?
SpongeBob: Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will! [runs off. Scene cuts to Weenie Hut Jr's]
Nerd #1: Couldn't get in, huh? What you need is a tough hairdo. No one gets into the Double S without a tough hairdo.
Nerd #2: I disagree, I saw a guy going in there and he was bald.
Nerd #1: I saw that guy. He wasn't bald. He had a shaved head. Shaved — that's a hairdo. Case closed. [both fish notice SpongeBob is gone] Hey, where'd he go?
Robot: I believe he said something about going to the wig store.
Nerd #1: Ha-ha! Check and mate. [Someone who looks like SpongeBob walks over to Reg with a cool, black wig on]
Drifter: What's shakin', my man?
Reg: Not much. Say, haven't I seen you before?
Drifter: Doubt it — I'm a drifter — just blew into town. Heard your club was pretty tough, thought I'd check it out.
Reg: Nice try, kid. I know it's you.
Drifter: What're you talking about? [Reg pulls Drifter's hair, but it is still attached to his head, it's real hair]
Reg: Aha! [the hair does not come off. SpongeBob walks up with a clown wig on]
SpongeBob: Hey, everybody, what's goin' on? [the Drifter gets angry as Reg tries to redo his hair, but can't do it]
Reg: Ah, you can go in. Sorry about that. [Drifter angrily walks in] Well, what do you want?
SpongeBob: I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order. [Reg takes the wig off SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob laughs nervously] So, uh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate? [a big, green fish walks up with a tattoo of a seahorse on his right arm]
Tough Fish #5: Hey-ya, Reg.
Reg: Alright, now it's a party! Oh, yeah, check out the new ink.
Tough Fish #5: Thanks. Hey, look what I can make it do. [moves his arm, which makes the seahorse tattoo wiggle]
Reg: [chuckles] Yeah. Hey, what about that one? [big, green fish looks at his left arm that has a SpongeBob tattoo on it]
Tough Fish #5: Huh, you know, I don't remember getting this one.
Reg: Can you make it dance?
Tough Fish #5: Well, here, let me try. [moves his arm. SpongeBob dances]
Reg: Hmmm, wait a minute. [rips SpongeBob off his arm] Go ahead in. [the tattoo fish walks in, rubbing his left arm]
Tough Fish #5: Yeah, sure, Reg. Thanks.
Reg: Nice try, little man. [throws SpongeBob to the back of the line behind two strong fish]
Tough Fish #6: Hey, I was in front of you!
Tough Fish #7: No, you weren't!
Tough Fish #6: You callin' me a liar?
Tough Fish #7: I ain't callin' you for dinner! [two start fighting. SpongeBob tries to run away, but the fight goes downhill, with him in it. Reg walks over]
Reg: Hold it, you two! That's enough, you're both plenty tough, go ahead in.
Tough Fish #6: Alright!
Tough Fish #7: Thanks, Reg. [both run off as SpongeBob comes out from under the sand]
SpongeBob: Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap. [He dusts his clothes using his hands]
Reg: [chortles] I saw you runnin'. When you get in a real fight, then we'll talk.
SpongeBob: Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch. [spins his legs, then his hands, and then cracks his fingers, but they are snapped in half. The scene cuts out to SpongeBob’s broken fingers. He starts to cry and runs off. Scene cuts to SpongeBob with his fingers in a bowl of ice cream, whimpering]
Robot: Care for another sundae, weenie?
SpongeBob: [jumps angrily] I am not a weenie!
Nerd #1: Relax, you're among friends. [raises his drink]
SpongeBob: My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's. [scroll over to Patrick in the seat next to him]
Patrick: You tell 'em, SpongeBob! [sips his drink]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what're you doing here?
Patrick: I'm always here on Double Weenie Wednesdays.
Nerd #1: Actually, they moved Double Weenie Wednesday to Friday.
Nerd #2: And besides, today's Monday.
Patrick: Oh, so it's Mega Weenie Monday?
Nerd #1: Uhh, that's now on Sunday.
Patrick: Barnacles!
Nerd #2: Super Weenie Hut Jr's has a Mega Weenie Monday.
Nerd #1: Uhh, no, you're thinking of Monster Weenie Monday.
SpongeBob: I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only way of getting into the Salty Spitoon! [begins to walks out]
Patrick: No, SpongeBob, you can't. It's too dangerous.
SpongeBob: I've got no choice.
Robot: I have a suggestion. Why not fake a fight?
Patrick: Hey, that's not a bad idea! You can call me a couple of bad names, we rumble, next thing you know, you're in the Salty Spitoon.
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it!
Patrick: Yeah! [both run out]
Nerd #1: Hey, how come you never help us out with our problems?
Robot: I am a robot, not a miracle worker. [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to Reg]
SpongeBob: Afternoon, Reg.
Reg: Whoa, whoa, little man. You still can't go in.
SpongeBob: Well, that makes me pretty mad.
Reg: Oh yeah?
SpongeBob: Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury.
Reg: [sarcastically] Wow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny.
Reg: Hmmm... what about that guy? [points to a large muscular fish behind him]
SpongeBob: [gasps and stammers] I, uh... [laughs] don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy! [points to Patrick]
Patrick: Who, me? [SpongeBob walks up to Patrick]
SpongeBob: Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners!
Patrick: Okay, but I must warn you. I happen to be a world championship... uhh... [looks at his hand, which has writing on it] ...kickboxer. [winks and gives a thumbs-up to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby! [Patrick starts to tear up]
Patrick: Tubby? [Patrick's sadness is quickly replaced by fury and he snarls with rage] Grr! Nobody calls me Tubby! [punches SpongeBob in the eye, leaving a black mark]
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember?
Patrick: Oh yeah. [invisible punches flying] No, please wait. [grunting as more invisible punches hit him and an elephant sound is heard when Patrick's head is hit. Patrick is being thrown into the air and on the ground, then given a wedgie] No, please, have mercy! [Patrick is kicked into the background]
Reg: Wow! You destroyed that guy without even touchin' him. [Patrick is still getting beaten in the background]
SpongeBob: I did?
Reg: I never thought I'd say this, but go ahead in.
SpongeBob: Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life! [walks in as Reg smiles. Scene cuts to an ambulance driving down the street with SpongeBob in bandages and Sandy by his side] Sandy? [groans] What happened?
Sandy: You ran inside and slipped on an ice cube. [ambulance arrives at the hospital. Scene cuts to Sandy wheeling SpongeBob in front of the doctor]
Doctor: What happened?
SpongeBob: I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos.
Doctor: Boo-boos, eh? Hmmm... I think you guys want that hospital. [points across the street to Weenie Hut General]
SpongeBob: Weenie Hut General?
SpongeBob: [runs outside to retrieve the newspaper] Gary, the paper's here! [Gary comes out on a motorized skateboard. SpongeBob gives him the paper but keeps the rubber band.] You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section! [shakes the rubber band around for emphasis. Hums while he stretches the rubber band around the middle of his body and snaps it together, turning him into a bowtie-like shape] I am a happy sponge! [runs around, laughing, while Gary is reading the paper]
Gary: [looking slightly annoyed by SpongeBob by rolling his eyes] Meow. [SpongeBob runs into Patrick, who also has a rubber band stretched around him]
Patrick: I see you got the paper. [his rubber band snaps off]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Patrick. [then his rubber band snaps off as well. Patrick clears his throat] Well, I'd better get going.
Patrick: Yep, see you later. [both walk off but then hear a chirping sound and they both quickly run back, with their hands over their ears]
SpongeBob and Patrick: What did you say?
Patrick: Well, I didn't say anything.
SpongeBob: I didn't say anything, either.
SpongeBob and Patrick: See you later then. [both walk off again and the squeaking noise is heard again, so they both run back. This time, they are angry]
SpongeBob: [Pointing at Patrick] Alright, quit messing with me, I know you said something.
Patrick: Ah, but it is you [points] that is messing with me. [both look down to see the squeaking noise is coming from a shaking branch. Patrick points downward.] That's what's messing with us.
SpongeBob: It's a baby scallop.
Patrick: [lifts up his foot with a threatening look on his face, looking as though he is about to smash the scallop] I'll take care of this!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick! It's totally helpless. [takes the baby scallop in his hands] It looks like he can't even fly yet.
Patrick: What's the matter, is he stupid?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's just a baby. [close-up of the chirping scallop in SpongeBob's hands] He's all alone with no one to take care of him.
Patrick: Well, we can't just leave him out here.
SpongeBob: You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple. [both run in and set the baby scallop on the ground] Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in. [SpongeBob removes his pants and sets it in front of the scallop] There you go. It's the best seat [points to his rear] in the house. [scene cuts to Gary, who does a rimshot]
Patrick: Let me see! [Patrick sticks his whole head inside SpongeBob's pants] Hey, he's kinda cute. Uh-oh! [takes his head out, which is now eaten on the side] I think somebody's hungry!
SpongeBob: [takes out Junior and speaks in baby-talk to it] Is it true? Are you hungry?
Junior: [chirping happily] Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!
SpongeBob: I've got just the thing. [puts Junior on a barrel and takes out a Krabby Patty] How would you like a Krabby Patty? [Junior yelps]
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants, are you crazy? That's not the right food for a little fella like him!
SpongeBob: Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty. [shows Junior a minuscule Krabby Patty]
Junior: [sniffs the patty, then sticks his tongue out in disgust] Blech!
SpongeBob: Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before. [gobbles it and gulps it down]
Patrick: [holds up a donut] Let's try a donut. [Junior hisses]
SpongeBob: [holds up a tray of French fries] French fries?
Junior: [shaking his head] Unh-unh.
Patrick: [eating the donut] A donut? [Junior blows a raspberry]
SpongeBob: [holds up an apple] All we have left is this apple. [a worm pokes its head out of the apple]
Worm: Hello, sea creatures! I bring you greetings from Apple World! [Junior chirps in excitement]
SpongeBob: Of course, scallops love worms. [picks up the worm]
Worm: Huh, wait! We will bury you! [SpongeBob drops it in Junior's mouth]
SpongeBob: Well, you should be good for the rest of the... [Junior cries]
Patrick: What now?
SpongeBob: I don't know! Aww, don't cry. [Junior is still crying]
Patrick: Do something, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah, look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo! Look at the funny face! [shows SpongeBob has a puppet that looks like him on his hand] Look at the funny face!
Patrick: Wait. I think I might know the problem. [picks up Junior and looks at him] Yep, that's it, alright. [hides it behind his back] Hold on just one second. There he is, good as new. [Junior has a diaper on]
SpongeBob: How did you know?
Patrick: How do you think? [drops his pants showing that he is wearing a diaper] And I've been doing it all by myself for almost a year.
SpongeBob: Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.
Patrick: I know, good thing there's two of us.
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves.
Patrick: Yeah. At least until it's old enough to be on its own! Oh, I wanna be the mom.
SpongeBob: I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.
Patrick: You're right. If I was a mom..., [the camera draws back to reveal Patrick's hairy, obese, unsightly form]...this would be kind of shocking. [lifts his arms, revealing armpit hair] Just call me Daddy!
Montage:
Patrick: [softly, from inside the house] It sure is cute when it's asleep.
SpongeBob: [softly, from inside the house] Yeah. [SpongeBob and Patrick watch Junior sleeping] Shh! [both tiptoe out of the room]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob? [goes to what appears to be the right side of the bed]
SpongeBob: [goes to what appears to be the left side] Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: I never thought being a parent could be this much fun.
SpongeBob: Me neither.
[scene zooms out, revealing that Patrick is sleeping on the bottom mattress and SpongeBob is sleeping on the top]
Patrick: Well, good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick. [SpongeBob's mattress slams shut on top of Patrick. Scene cuts to morning] Patrick, breakfast is ready. [SpongeBob is cooking something over at the grill as Patrick walks in, noticing the bunch of food that is on the table]
Patrick: Alright. All this parenting stuff makes me hungry. [lifts the table up as all the food slides down into mouth. He burps, then pats Junior] Hey, Junior, how are you doing today? [smells an odor from Junior] SpongeBob? [adjusts his tie]
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Kid's got a stinky.
SpongeBob: [doing many chores at the same time] Can you take care of him? My hands are kind of full. [Patrick guzzles down the coffee as Junior begins to cry]
Patrick: [drinking coffee] Ahh. Wish I could, but I gotta get going.
SpongeBob: Going? Where are you going?
Patrick: [puts on a suit and takes his briefcase] I'm goin' to work. I'm the dad, remember?
SpongeBob: You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself?
Patrick: I'll give you a break tonight when I get home. Don't you two stop being adorable. [chuckles as he closes the door]
SpongeBob: Okay. [chuckles weakly. Day turns into night, and Patrick walks in and takes his jacket and hat off]
Patrick: Phew, what a day.
SpongeBob: Oh, great, you're home. Now you can help me with the baby.
Patrick: Aw, gee, SpongeBob, I'd love to, but I'm totally beat from work.
SpongeBob: Huh? [Patrick sits down and watches TV. A coconut "clonk" sound effect is heard.]
Patrick: [laughs] That guy got hit in the head with a coconut!
SpongeBob: [walks in still doing the chores] Patrick, what about my break?
Patrick: Oh yeah, your break. Uh, tomorrow, I promise.
SpongeBob: Uhh, okay, tomorrow.
Narrator: Tomorrow... [scene cuts to Patrick walking in at night and taking his stuff off]
Patrick: Phew, another tough day. [walks by SpongeBob, who is still doing the same chores from yesterday]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, I'm so glad you're home after working all day. I can't wait for my break.
Patrick: Work was a killer. I need my chair. [sits down and watches TV again]
SpongeBob: [walks in still doing chores] Patrick, I really need my...
Patrick: Tomorrow for sure.
Narrator: Tomorrow for sure... [scene cuts to a tired SpongeBob doing the same chores as Patrick walks by]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: I'll get to it eventually...
Narrator: Eventually... [scene cuts to SpongeBob still doing the chores but even more tired]
SpongeBob: Uhhh?
Patrick: Uhhh.
Narrator: Uhhh... [scene cuts to Patrick watching TV as an angry SpongeBob walks in and turns on the lights]
SpongeBob: Patrick Star, we need to talk.
Patrick: Just one more minute, I gotta...
SpongeBob: Don't 'one more minute' me, Mr. Man! [turns off the TV]
Patrick: Hey, I'm missin' the coconut! [he gives SpongeBob an angry look]
SpongeBob: You haven't been helping at all with Junior! [pulls in baby stroller] We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything.
Patrick: I changed his diaper!
SpongeBob: Yeah, once.
Patrick: He's only this big. [shows with his hands on how big Junior is] How many diapers could he possibly use?
SpongeBob: [opens up a trash can full of diapers] Hmmm?
Patrick: Oh, that's not so much.
SpongeBob: [points over to the corner of the room where there are two bags and a trash can full of diapers] Hmmm?
Patrick: [nervously] So?
SpongeBob: [opens up the refrigerator, full of diapers] Hmmm? [pulls the cover off the couch, revealing it to be diapers] Hmmm? [tears the wallpaper off the wall, revealing a bunch of diapers behind it] Hmmm!? [points outside to a garbage truck loading a bunch of diapers into the dumpster. Patrick quivers at the sight of it]
Patrick: [his eyes fill with tears] I have no idea! What kind of a father am I?! Oh! [sobs as he looks at SpongeBob as he smiles] I'll make it up to you, buddy. I promise. [scene cuts to next day]
SpongeBob: So, what's the plan for the day?
Patrick: No more foolin' around. From now on, I'm Super-Dad! I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time. So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal.
SpongeBob: [gives Patrick his briefcase as he departs] Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: Six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: [waving] Six o'clock.
Patrick: [waving] Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: Six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock. [cuts to a time card]
Narrator: 12:00 midnight.
[Patrick walks in with a lampshade over his head, giggling and turns on the light]
Patrick: Oh, that was some party. [SpongeBob is wearing his mother-like clothing and he gives Patrick a bitter look] Oh, hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Junior. [SpongeBob now looks at Patrick angrily as he taps his foot] What? What?
SpongeBob: Oh, nothing.
Patrick: Oh, what a relief. [takes the lampshade off his head and puts it on SpongeBob] For a second there, I thought you were mad at me.
SpongeBob: [takes the lampshade off his head] Do you remember what you said to me this morning?
Patrick: Somethin' about root beer, right?
SpongeBob: [takes a deep breath, flatly] No.
Patrick: Oh wait, wait, let me guess. I give up.
SpongeBob: Does... [imitates Patrick in a mocking tone with a goofy look on his face] "You can take the night off, pal!" [normal voice] ...ring a bell?
Patrick: [raspberry] I don't need this. [walks outside]
SpongeBob: What?! [walks to the door] Where do you think you're going?
Patrick: [opens his rock] I'm going back to work! [gets in and closes his rock]
SpongeBob: Work?! [growls and rips off his hairpiece]
[Cut to SpongeBob, not wearing his mother-like clothing anymore, walking outside to Patrick's rock. He opens it up, and finds Patrick in his easy chair, watching TV]
Patrick: [two "clonk" sounds are heard on the TV; laughs] He got hit in the head with two coconuts!
SpongeBob: [angrily] So, this is work?
Patrick: You know, it's not as easy as it looks. Sometimes, I gotta move the antenna, sometimes, I lose the remote, [looks at his rear] and sometimes, my butt itches real bad!
SpongeBob: [sarcastically] Oh, you poor, poor thing. By the way, you forgot your briefcase! [he pulls a briefcase out from behind his back, and opens it up to reveal that it is filled with donuts and ice cream sundaes as he angrily dumps it all over Patrick]
Patrick: [quietly but furiously] Oh, so this is the thanks I get for working overtime?
[SpongeBob is enraged. He balls his fists and fumes so hard, his entire body shakes. Then he loses his temper and goes ballistic on Patrick, and his face morphs into a stereotypical Asian face with lots of teeth.]
SpongeBob: [Screaming intensely] OVERTIME?!
[SpongeBob jumps into Patrick's rock, and they both begin to argue intensely.]
Patrick: Yeah, overtime, pal!
SpongeBob: [overlapping Patrick] Oh, boy, yeah, you're working!
Patrick: You know what that means?
SpongeBob: And that's the kind of work you're doing?
Patrick: It means working when you're just too tired to work!
SpongeBob: Show me where I can sign up for this, because I've been working my fingers to the bone!
[Junior is heard beginning to chirp]
Patrick: You just keep going on working and working!
SpongeBob: You never help! [screams] NEVER!
[Junior's chirping intensifies, which makes the two finally stop arguing and listen to it]
Patrick: [still mad] There's that stupid noise again!
SpongeBob: Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window.
[Patrick and SpongeBob see Junior teetering on the edge of the window of SpongeBob's house, ready to fly.]
Patrick: [calmly] Oh.
[All at once, Patrick and SpongeBob are struck with shock by what's really happening.]
Both: [eyes bulge in horror, screaming] JUNIOR!
[Junior jumps down the window. SpongeBob and Patrick quickly run to catch Junior but they slam on SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob then bounces out of Patrick's stomach]
SpongeBob: [Frantic] Did you catch him?!
Patrick: [looking sadly at his empty hands] No.
Both: We're bad parents! [They break down sobbing. Then they stop when they notice that chirping Junior is flying above them.]
SpongeBob: Junior? Hey, he's flying.
Patrick: I guess he's all grown up. [Junior kisses SpongeBob then flies off] Hey, what about Daddy? [Junior drops a coconut on Patrick's head for his laziness then kisses him] That's my boy.
SpongeBob: Goodbye.
Patrick: [the coconut falls down] Goodbye, Junior.
[they watch Junior fly away]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore.
Patrick: This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume.
SpongeBob: Despite all we've been through, it was worth it.
Patrick: Yeah... Let's have another.
[SpongeBob looks shocked]
[Mr. Krabs wakes up in his hammock in his bedroom. The radio clicks on]
Radio DJ: You've got it tuned to K-O-L-D, K-Old, your all-oldies station. Here's a little something you may remember from the good old days.
 You're old... Groaning like a geezer  [Mr. Krabs opens his eyes, which are crusty and coated in barnacles]  Feel yourself a-crackin' like an old has-been  [Mr. Krabs gets out of bed with all his joints cracking when he moves]  Look at yourself, old man, you've got multiple chins  [Mr. Krabs looks in his bathroom mirror. He pulls down his shirt to show a bunch of chins]  'Cause you're old...  [scene cuts to the kitchen. Mr. Krabs sits down at the table as Pearl comes in]
Pearl Krabs: Good morning, Daddy. [gives him a kiss] I made you breakfast.
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, sweet pea. I see you got creative with the bran today. [looks down at the plate to see his bran shaped as bacon, eggs, juice, and others]
Pearl: Open up, it's time for the pill. [Pearl takes out a giant pill]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, barnacles! I hate the pill. [Pearl shoves the giant pill in his mouth and he swallows it] Pearl, do you think I'm... old?
Pearl: Well, of course I do! But that's okay. Daddies are supposed to be old.
Mr. Krabs: But I'm still cool, right? Your old man is cool?
Pearl: See, no one says cool anymore. That's such an old-person thing. Now we say "coral," as in, "That nose job is so coral."
Mr. Krabs: Coral, eh?
Pearl: Eww, when you say it, it sounds so uncoral.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what if I said it with a different inflection? Co-ral.
Pearl: Don't you have to go to work or something, Dad?
Mr. Krabs: Whoop, you're right! [eats his breakfast] Have a coral day, honey.
Pearl: [picks up her phone and dials] Jenny? It's Pearl. "Coral" is definitely out. [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs walking outside]
Mr. Krabs: Ha! Old? What was I thinkin'? I ain't old. Huh? [turns around to see a boy helping him walk across]
Boy Scout: Don't worry, Pops, we're almost across the street.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, get away from me. I don't need no snot-nosed little... [as he walks away, his arm comes off. Walks back to get it] Sorry you had to see that. [keeps walking to work where a fish is walking behind him]
Harold: Come on, move it! Could you be any slower? And you've had your blinker on for the last five blocks. [Mr. Krabs turns around and notices he has two signals on his behind, the right arrow is blinking, so he covers his behind. He continues to walk until a ball rolls next to him]
Tyler: Hey, mister, could you throw the ball back over here?
Mr. Krabs: [picks up the ball] Hey, how's about I join you kids?
Tyler: Uhh, that's okay. You can keep it. Why do old people always have to ruin the fun? [Mr. Krabs drops the ball. He walks up to a line of elderly fish]
Elderly Fish #1: Hey, no cuttin'! You gotta wait your turn in line like everybody else! [Mr. Krabs notices a long line in front of the Bikini Bottom Cemetery]
Mr. Krabs: No! No! I ain't old like you! I ain't old! I ain't old! [runs away]
Elderly Fish #2: What's his problem? [the line is for ice cream]
Lou: Next? [scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is sitting a table depressed]
Timmy: Mommy, my Krabby Patty tastes funny.
Mother: Well, no wonder. It's all old and dried out. Like that man right there. [points to Mr. Krabs] Now put that thing where it belongs... in the garbage.
Timmy:  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la...  [Timmy walks up to the trashcan, but Mr. Krabs grabs his patty before he can get there]
Mr. Krabs: Well, little patty, we're two of a kind. We've both lost our luster. [takes a bite out of the patty] Hmmm, so that's what I taste like.
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew! [SpongeBob pokes his head out of the kitchen window]
SpongeBob: [shouts] Hey, Patrick! You all ready for the big night out tonight?
Patrick: [shouts] Yeah, it's gonna rock!
SpongeBob: Are you ready to go crazy?
Patrick: I'm already hearing voices!
SpongeBob: Are you ready to—
Squidward: SPONGEBOB! PATRICK! DO YOU MIND?!
SpongeBob: Let's continue this conversation in private, Patrick. I think some people are eavesdropping!
Patrick: Well, how rude of some people!
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, those youngsters are goin’ out for a big night on the town. [stretches his eyes into the kitchen where SpongeBob and Patrick are talking]
SpongeBob: Whoo! I've been lookin’ forward to this night all week!
Patrick: Party!
SpongeBob: What do you think we should do first?
Patrick: What shouldn't we do first? We're young, [Mr. Krabs' eyes move a little closer] we've got wheels, [Mr. Krabs' eyes move closer] the world is our oyster! SpongeBob, you got something on your shoulder. [SpongeBob notices Mr. Krabs' eyes are on his shoulders]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, boys, hangin' out?
Patrick: [looks at his large belly] Yes.
Mr. Krabs: I couldn't help overhearin’ your big plans. And I was wondering if you had room for one more craaaaazy dude tonight, huh?
SpongeBob: Of course. Did you wanna come with us, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hadn't even crossed me mind. But, sure, I'll go!
Patrick: I don't know, SpongeBob. He might cramp our style.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [appear in a picture with a goofy look on them] Style!
Patrick: Let's see if he knows the secret cool-guy handshake. [holds out his hand]
Mr. Krabs: Uhh, yeah, course I know it! [begins to sweat] Uhh... uhh...
Patrick: I'm waiting... old man.
Mr. Krabs: [shakes Patrick's hand] Uhh... how do you do?
Patrick: Fine, and you? All right, you're in. But I'm not happy about it.
SpongeBob: You passed the test, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Great! Why don't you boys show up at my house at eight o'clock?
SpongeBob: I just wanna warn you, Mr. Krabs. We're always fashionably late.
French Narrator: 8:01 PM. [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' house. The doorbell rings]
SpongeBob: Hey there, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready to party?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party?
Patrick: I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, Patrick?
Patrick: I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm ready to party! Are you ready to par- [Pearl runs by them]
Pearl: Stop it, just stop it! You're embarrassing me, Dad! [sobbing]
Mr. Krabs: So, what kind of hot rod will we be cruisin’ in tonight?
SpongeBob: Only the most powerful chick magnet in town. The Underwater Heartbreaker. [we see a bike with two streamers on each handle]
Mr. Krabs: It's more like a chick repellent. And there's only two seats.
SpongeBob: Calm your waters, Mr. Krabs. I modified this little baby myself. [scene cuts to SpongeBob & Patrick riding at the front of the bike, while Mr. Krabs is in a wagon behind them]
Mr. Krabs: Are you sure this is what the kids are drivin’ these days?
SpongeBob: Only the cool kids. [a hot rod, driven by a young teen, pulls up beside them]
Driver: Hey, you guys must be lost. Doofus Drive is around the corner!
SpongeBob: We're not lost, I've got my compass. [shows him the compass]
Driver: So long, dorks! [speeds away]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, pals!
Mr. Krabs: We used to beat people up for sayin’ things like that! Everything's all topsy-turvy now. [they pull up to 'The Wash']
SpongeBob: Here we are: The Wash.
Mr. Krabs: They sure are giving these clubs some crazy names! I have to tell you boys... I'm a little nervous. I haven't been, you know, on the scene for quite a while now.
SpongeBob: Just follow our lead, Mr. Krabs. And, above all, keep it cool.
Mr. Krabs: Cool. Gotcha. [SpongeBob and Patrick walk away jumping up and down in a goofy way. Mr. Krabs does the same]
SpongeBob: [opens door] Hello, gang! SpongeBob's back!
Patrick: Let's party!
Mr. Krabs: Any port in the store—! Wait a minute. This is a Laundromat. [scene shows the entire room is a place to do your laundry]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [all three looking at their reflections in the washer] Oh yeah, whoo! That's what I'm talkin’ about. Oh, yeah! Yeah, the colors! whoo! [washer stops]
SpongeBob: You guys want another rinse cycle? I'm buyin’.
Mr. Krabs: You know, I love staring at delicates as much as the next guy, but it's just that I thought we'd see more of the nightlife. Somethin’ that'll give you that wild and crazy hot-blooded feelin’, if you know what I mean.
SpongeBob: Oh, I know what you mean, Mr. Krabs. This is only stop numero uno on our night of debauchery!
Patrick: Debauchery!
Mr. Krabs: Debauchery! [scene cuts to the road where all three are picking up trash] Debauchery? I never thought of picking up trash under the highway as hot-blooded, but if it's what the kids are into...
SpongeBob: So, are you feeling that wild and crazy feeling, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Not yet.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, you will. [scene cuts to all three in a kiddie swimming pool] Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm feeling a warm spot.
Patrick: Sorry. [scene cuts to them riding kiddie rides outside Barg'n Mart]
SpongeBob: Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Are you feeling it?
Patrick: I'm feeling it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Patrick, that's not a ride. [Patrick is riding on Harold's back]
Harold: Get off of me! [scene cuts to them getting their teeth pulled]
SpongeBob: Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? [scene cuts to them redoing a roof] Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? [scene cuts to them dressed in costumes playing Dungeons and Dragons] Art thou feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? [scene cuts to the library] Can you feel it now, Mr. Krabs?
Miss Shell: Shh! [scene cuts to a place called "Bunny Buns," an area for kids to play in]
SpongeBob: How about now? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? [kids in the room around running around Mr. Krabs, hanging on his hat streamers. Mr. Krabs has clown make-up on his face]
Kids: Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: So, you wanna know if I can feel it?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: Do you really wanna know if I can feel it?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah, yeah!
Mr. Krabs: Because I can feel it. You wanna know what I'm feelin'?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yes!
Mr. Krabs: [angry] I'm feelin' like a total barnacle head! [swings the screaming kids around and around then off his hat] You think this is cool?! [jumps on a bunny and punches its head off] How about this! [jumps on top of the bunny] And this? Am I with it now? [runs up to SpongeBob and Patrick] You guys wouldn't know a good time if it bit you in the end! I'm goin’ home. You guys ain't cool. You're lame!
SpongeBob: [sadly] Lame?!
Mr. Krabs: Lame! You're nerds! Geeks! Creeps! And babies!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Not 'babies!' [both suck their thumbs]
Mr. Krabs: I may be old, but even an old bag of shells like me knows that you haven't suggested one cool thing all night! So good night to ya!
Patrick: I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.
Mr. Krabs: The what?
Patrick: I said, I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.
Mr. Krabs: Panty raid? You're talkin’ about girls, right? “Girl” girls?
Patrick: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: And you're talkin’ about raidin’ their dressers for their underpants, right?
Patrick: Oh, yeah.
Mr. Krabs: Well, count me in! If this works, I'll take back what I said about you two bein’ lame!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [happy] Not lame! [scene cuts to the three of them carrying a ladder]
Mr. Krabs: Now this is more like it! [lean the ladder against a house]
Patrick: Give us some credit, old man. We're panty professionals! [climbs the ladder]
SpongeBob: We score here all the time. [all three tiptoe into a bedroom. Mr. Krabs opens a drawer and takes out a pair of panties]
Mr. Krabs: Frilly things! We hit the jackpot! [everyone jumps up and down]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [holds up the pair of underwear he got] You finally came through for me, boys! I feel young again! [light turns on]
Mama Krabs: Eugene?
Mr. Krabs: Mother?
Mama Krabs: What are you doing with my bloomers?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I, uhh, uhh, heh, [hides his mother's bloomers behind his back] hehe... [turns around to SpongeBob and Patrick] Why didn't you tell me this was my mother's house?!
SpongeBob: Why didn't you ask? [both run away. Mr. Krabs turns around to see his mother angry]
Mr. Krabs: [he giggles nervously then he hides his mother's bloomers behind his back] But it was all SpongeBob and Patrick's idea!
Mama Krabs: Go to your room, mister. You're grounded for the rest of the night!
Mr. Krabs: [walks away] Yes, Mommy. [boy scout from earlier is walking with Mr. Krabs]
Boy Scout: Don't worry, Pops. We're almost to your room. [Mr. Krabs groans. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' bedroom. SpongeBob peeks through the window]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] That's all right, lad. I certainly feel younger. [scene zooms out revealing Mr. Krabs is lying on his racecar-shaped bed]
SpongeBob: Good night, Mr. Krabs. [leaves]
Mr. Krabs: Good night, SpongeBob.
Mama Krabs: [outside. We see SpongeBob leaving] Eugene, lights out!
Mr. Krabs: Yes, Mommy. [light turns off]
[SpongeBob is carrying a big sack of snail food]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Carrying this heavy bag of snail food for Gary.
Patrick: How is Gary?
SpongeBob: He's fine. Uh, Pat, can we talk about this some other time? This snail food is really heavy.
Patrick: Oh, sure, but there was something I wanted to tell you...something important. Oh, I remember. Uh... [SpongeBob is gone] Who was I talking to?
SpongeBob: [puts the bag of snail food down and notices a piece of paper on the door] Ahoy, Captain, what have we here? It's a tiny form letter. "Dear Sir or Ma'am... [goes inside] We are sorry we missed you. We will attempt to re-deliver your package at our earliest convenience." [doorbell rings] Hello? [gasps] My package. Whoopee! [takes it inside while leaving the bag of snail food outside] Oh, let's see what we got here. [cuts it open] My official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy paddleball set. Whoo! Yeah! [grunts] What's this? "Take the Dirty Bubble Challenge! Hit the paddleball 29,998,559,671,349 times in a row." Dirty Bubble, wherever you float, I hereby accept your challenge. [takes the ball and hits it on the paddle, but it comes back and hits him in the eye] Darn it. [Tries again; results are the same] Darn it. [this happens again] Darn it.
Gary: [goes into the kitchen and sees that his food bowl is empty. He checks the time and it is snack time] Meow.
SpongeBob: [paddleball hits him in the eye again] Darn it.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What was that?
Gary: [louder] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, that distracting sound came from you. I'm sorry, I can't play with you right now. Mermaid Man needs me. [when he tries the paddleball again, Gary interrupts]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary, please! I'm trying to defeat the Dirty Bubble. [when he lifts his paddleball up, Gary is attached to it]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: So, let's get this straight, Gary. You don't want me to defeat the Dirty Bubble. You know, Dirty Bubble—terror of the seven seas, arch nemesis of my favorite TV superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and apparently renowned paddleball champion. [Dirty Bubble on the box laughs] Well, I for one, recognize the importance of this undertaking. But whether or not you do remains to be seen. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to it. [Gary slithers off] Pets. Sometimes, I wonder if they understand a word you're saying. [Gary jumps on SpongeBob's face, making him run around and scream] Gary, I hate it when you do that! Now get! [throws him away and grunts] And leave your master to his important affairs. [Gary rolls into his bowl and sees a crumb of food left. A bunch of spiders crawl out of it. Gary packs his things] Hey, I got one! Dirty Bubble, say your prayers.
Gary: Meow. [Gary slithers off away, down a river, and takes a bus out of town. Cut to next day]
Patrick: [drinks his coffee, then eats the cup] I haven't seen SpongeBob in a couple days. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I remembered what I wanted to tell him. [knocks on the door, then notices the bag of snail food on the ground] That's strange... Usually, I knock on the with this hand. [walks in] Hey, SpongeBob, you around? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [muffled] Darn it.
Patrick: SpongeBob, is that you?
SpongeBob: [muffled] Oh, darn it. Darn it.
Patrick: SpongeBob? [opens the door to the galley to SpongeBob lying on the ground]
SpongeBob: Darn it. Darn it.
Patrick: SpongeBob, what happened? [runs over to a picture of a Krabby Patty on the wall] This picture is crooked. SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [looks at the paddle] Darn it.
Patrick: Snap out of it.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I...
Patrick: What is it, buddy? You can tell me.
SpongeBob: I took the Dirty Bubble challenge.
Patrick: You what?! [cries]
SpongeBob: Why are you crying, Patrick?
Patrick: Because... many years ago, I took that challenge.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: What happened?
Patrick: I won. But then I lost the trophy they sent me.
SpongeBob: You lost the...? That's terrible! Come on, Pat. Let's have some kelp cookies and seahorse milk—that always cheers me up when I've lost something. There you are, Pat. Fresh seahorse milk.
Patrick: Thanks, buddy.
SpongeBob: Hey, Pat, you ever feel like you're forgetting something? Something important? [trips over Gary's bowl] Hmmm. I think it has something to do with this bowl. Gary's food bowl. That's it—I gotta feed Gary. [gets the bag of snail food outside] That's a lot of dust for a couple of hours. [brings it in and pours it in Gary's bowl] Gary! Dinner! [takes out a triangle] Come on, Gary, soup's on. [rings it] Gary? Hey, Pat?
Patrick: Yeah?
SpongeBob: How long was I taking the Dirty Bubble challenge?
Patrick: About a week.
SpongeBob: A week? Are you sure?
Patrick: Hmmm... well... [pours the glass of milk upside down. The milk is revealed to be solid, which falls like jelly. Sniffs the jelly. Starts eating the solid milk, analyzing the taste closely. Makes a sour face after tasting the overly sour taste.] Yeah, it's about a week, maybe ten days.
SpongeBob: Ten days? Gary! [searches all over the house for Gary] Gary? Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Patrick!
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: [his eyes fill up with tears as his lip quivers] I can't find Gary.
Gary: [is slithering across the sand. Echoing howls are heard. Gary looks at his stomach and it's howling at him. Gary sneezes] Meow.
SpongeBob: This never fails. Gary's favorite treats. Gary can't resist these babies. They're filled with eight types of organic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of.
Patrick: Eight?
SpongeBob: Yeah, something like that. All you really have to do is shake the can. Gary comes running every time. Go on, Pat, try it. [Patrick shakes it, but it makes no noise] Let me see that. [SpongeBob tries it, but it still makes no noise] Hmm, I don't understand, this is a brand-new... [Patrick belches. SpongeBob shakes his belly and Patrick laughs]
Patrick: I only tasted six types of sediment. [cut to nighttime where SpongeBob and Patrick are searching for Gary. Patrick is shaking his belly]
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here? [lifts a flower up] Gary! Keep shaking, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh. [jiggles his belly]
SpongeBob: Gary!
Squidward: What are those Neanderthals up to? Don't they know I'm busy spoiling myself? [SpongeBob and Patrick open Squidward's door while he is in the bathtub] [screams three times and pants]
SpongeBob: You check over there. I'll check in here. [checks in the bathtub Squidward is in] Find him yet, Pat?
Patrick: [pulls the sink out from the wall, making water shoot out everywhere] No, but I'll keep looking.
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] But there's nowhere left to look.
Patrick: There's one place we haven't checked. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick standing in front of the former's mailbox full of letters]
SpongeBob: I doubt Gary could fit in there.
Patrick: Can't hurt to look.
SpongeBob: Here goes nothing. [opens the mailbox and a bunch of letters shoot out and a rolled up paper falls on the ground] Look, Pat!
Patrick: What is it?
SpongeBob: Let's see. "Dear SpongeBob, These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. Don't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary. At least until my new owner renames me." Dear Neptune, what have I done?
Patrick: What do you mean? You drove him away. It's right there in black and white. See? Right there and there.
SpongeBob: Gary. [cut to Gary slithering into another town. A couple walks by him laughing, then sees Fred and Debbie Rechid eating inside a diner]
Fred: Are my pants too tight, dear? [takes a bite out of his burger, then notices Gary outside and closes the blinds on the window as they both laugh. Gary slithers along more until he stops and sees some nachos in an alleyway. When he is about to take a bite of it, three snails frighten him by hissing]
Snail #1: Look who came to dinner. [Gary runs away]
Snail #3: Guess he didn't like nachos. [Gary slithers away until he runs into a dark figure]
Gramma: There you are. [grabs Gary] There you are, Miss Tuffsy. Oh, gramma finally found you. She was starting to get worried. Now let's get to your home, Miss Tuffsy, and get you something to eat. Hmmm. [shakes Gary] You feel much lighter than Gramma remembers. [cut to Gramma's house where she is feeding Gary heart-shaped cookies and putting an electric blanket over him] There you go, Miss Tuffsy. Gramma knows you like your Mr. Heaty set to extra cozy when you're home relaxing.
Gary: Mmm.
Gramma: Goodness, you're almost out of cookies. Here, I'll go and get some more. Now, don't you go running off again. [Gary looks at a spoon collection and looks at a picture of snails] There you go. [puts some more cookies on] After this, I'll go make up some of those deviled eggs I promised. [drops empty cookie sheet] Oh, how about a little music? Gramma's got a killer stereo system. [music warbling faster as Gramma cranks the record player. Gary continues to eat cookies as jazz music begins to play] Oh, this song reminds Gramma of her days as a riveter. [dances] You make Gramma feel so young. Come on, Miss Tuffsy, let's do the boogie-woogie. [while doing the dance, she breaks her back] Oh. [set Gary back on the chair] Okay, oh, that's enough of the boogie-woogie for now.
SpongeBob: Gary! Gary? Gary! [looks into a hat store. On the reflection of the window, a truck with a picture of a snail drives by and stops. SpongeBob turns around] Gary! [truck's logo says "Hungry Snails Loves Snail-Po". Tires squeal as the dust gets into SpongeBob's face and makes him cough] Gary...! [crying] Oh... Gary! [fade out to Gramma and Gary sitting on the couch watching TV]
Gramma: Gramma knows how much you love these late-night crime drama programs. Don't you, Miss Tuffsy? Oh, heavens, look at the time. [clock reads 7:30] It's time for bed, Miss Tuffsy. [when Gary jumps off the couch, a picture of SpongeBob comes out of his bag]
Gary: [sadly] Meow.
Picture of SpongeBob: Quiet, Gary! Can't you see I'm busy? [Gary gives a raspberry. Gary goes into a bright and decorated room with Gramma]
Gramma: Here's your room, Miss Tuffsy.
Gary: [questioningly] Meow?
Gramma: Here you are, darling. Let Gramma tuck you in. There you go. Oh, [Gary's sad, precious round eyes sparkle up at Gramma] I almost forgot your good night kiss. [kisses Gary] Sweet dreams, Miss Tuffsy. [walks out of the room and claps twice to make the lights go out. Cut to next day at the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is walking into the Krusty Krab on his knees. He has bloodshot eyes]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're 15 minutes late.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was out all night looking for Gary. You see, he ran away and, well, now I...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you okay? You look kinda...different.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call okay, Mr. Krabs. You see, my...
Mr. Krabs: [snaps fingers] Aha! You just forgot to put your hat on. [puts his hat on his head] Knew I'd figure it out.
SpongeBob: [his tears drop on the patty] Gary.
Evelyn: Yeah, I'd like a refund for this Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: Refund?! What's wrong with it?
Evelyn: Oh, nothing, really... except that it's covered in tears! [reveals that there are six tears on the patty]
Mr. Krabs: What the...?
SpongeBob: Gary... [crying]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! There's customers out there, boy, waiting to be fed!
SpongeBob: This wouldn't be the first time I disappointed someone who was hungry.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boy, why don't you tell Mr. Krabs what's wrong.
SpongeBob: Well, you see...
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob's mouth] That's enough, boy. See, it's not always what you say that matters. Sometimes, it's what you don't say. Understand?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs. I should've told Gary how important he was to me.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this: any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work.
SpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: That's me boy!
SpongeBob: If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it.
Mr. Krabs: Wh...?
[cut to Patrick sleeping on the ground. A bunch of things fall on Patrick and wake him up]
Patrick: It's the apocalypse! Office products falling from the sky!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. We're going to use this stuff to go find Gary.
Patrick: But I thought you drove him away with your neglect and indifference.
SpongeBob: [sighs] Patrick, now is not the time for talking. We've got work to do. [cut to Gramma]
Gramma: [squeezing orange juice from the orange] There you go, Miss Tuffsy—fresh squeezed. It takes longer to make it that way, but it was a labor of love.
Gary: Meow.
Gramma: How about a little more syrup on those pancakes? [pours syrup on the pancakes. Then takes the spoon and scoops up a bite for Gary] Here comes the train. Hoo-hoo! [cut to Gramma and Gary in the car] Set phasers on fun, Miss Tuffsy. [engine revving, tires squeal as Gramma drives fast over to Martha's Craft Zone] Oh, here we are. [both walk inside. As soon as the door closes, SpongeBob and Patrick arrive in the front door with posters and tape]
SpongeBob: Here's a good spot. [puts a poster on the door] "Gary! I am sorry! Please come home! Love, SpongeBob". Quick, hand me the tape.
Patrick: Hey, they're having a sale on scented pine cones.
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is no time for that. [Patrick goes in. SpongeBob sighs]
Patrick: Pine cones, pine cones, pine cones.
Gramma: These pipe cleaners are simply delightful.
Patrick: Old lady, quick. I'm looking for the scented pine cones. It's an emergency!
Gramma: Well, I hope you weren't looking to buy them, sonny, because Gramma already picked up all they had.
Patrick: Once again, you and I are kept apart, oh sweet scented pine cones. Hey, Gary. [walks out as Gary stares at him]
SpongeBob: [finishes putting up the posters] There.
Patrick: When Patrick comes out, the posters on the door are torn in half] Um...uhh...
SpongeBob: Come on, Pat, just take these fliers and hand them out. [walk off]
Gramma: [walks out] Come on, Miss Tuffsy, there's plenty more fun to be had.
 Gary, now I know I was wrong, I messed up, and now you're gone. Gary, I'm sorry I neglected you. Oh, I never expected you to run away and leave me feeling this empty. Your meow right now would sound like music to me. Please come home, 'cause I miss you, Gary. Gary, come home. Gary, can't you see I was blind, I'll do anything to change your mind. More than a pet, you're my best friend, too cool to forget, come back 'cause we are family and forgive me for making you wanna roam. And now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome. Somewhere I hope you're reading my latest three-word poem: Gary, come home! 
Patrick: I want peanuts. [presses button in the airplane]
SpongeBob: Pat, no! [airplane loses control. Both scream as the airplane rides through the message in the sky "GARY COME HOME" and changes it to "LISA, WILL YOU MARRY ME?"]
Mable: Who is this 'Lisa' person?
Lenny: What? [Mable slaps him. Cut to Gramma walking into her house]
Gramma: Gramma will get a lovely meat loaf in the oven for you.
Gary: Meow.
Gramma: Don't worry, it's no trouble at all. Easy to do. [Gary smells his newspaper pile]
Gary: Meow.
Gramma: Oh, Miss Tuffsy, do you have to go potty? Here, why don't you use this stack of fliers given to me today by a little chubby boy. [Gary reads all the fliers that SpongeBob and Patrick made. Gary imagines SpongeBob in a thought bubble]
SpongeBob: Gary, please come back to me! Go, boy, go! [Gramma whistles]
Gramma: You stay right there. The meatloaf is almost done. [Gary groans, then slithers over and opens a closet door to find a bunch of empty snail shells] Oh, dear. The meatloaf is not quite ready yet, but Gramma knows how hungry you are, Miss Tuffsy, so she whipped up a quick batch of cookies. [belt on Gary's belly snaps. A bunch of fat breaks through his shell. The snails in the painting on the wall talk]
Snails in picture: Run! [Gary strains to get out of the shell pile, but does and rolls toward Gramma's cookie plate and out the pet door. She tries to throw cookies at him, but they get stuck in the door]
Gramma: You don't want cookies? Don't fret, I made a batch of deviled eggs, too. [Gary looks behind him and Gramma is slowly walking behind him] Come back, Miss Tuffsy. You don't want these to go to waste, do you? They were a labor of love. [Gary hides behind some trashcans in the alleyway] Oh, don't worry, Miss Tuffsy, Gramma will find you.
Snail #3: Hey! You're the guy that doesn't like nachos.
Gramma: Miss Tuffsy, I know you're back there, I can't hear your stomach growling. [Gary pushes Snail #3 out into the sidewalk]
Snail #3: Hey!
Gramma: Oh, there you are, Miss Tuffsy.
Snail #3: Who?
Gramma: You must be starving. [Gary sighs deeply. Cut to SpongeBob trying to cry on his couch]
Patrick: Just let it out, buddy. That's right.
SpongeBob: I can't cry anymore, Patrick. When Gary left, he took all my tears with him.
Patrick: Did you just say Gary? SpongeBob, I just remembered earlier today at the craft store, I saw... these huge chunks of balsa wood! [SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears] They were awesome!
SpongeBob: Gary loved balsa wood! [runs off crying] I got to try to forget Gary. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind. [look at the giant sign of Gary] I blew it, I really blew it. I took you for granted, Gary. I'm sorry! Don't just stare at me, say something! I'm talking to a billboard.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Now I'm hearing things. If only I could see you one more time so I could tell you how much I love you. If only I could hear you meow one last time.
Gary: [climbs on SpongeBob's head] Meow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, like that. [Gary purrs] Gary, your purring is making it hard to forget you... GARY! Oh, Gary! [He kisses Gary] So, did you hear any of that, or do I have to repeat myself?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Okay, good. I promise, Gary, things are going to be different between you and I. You'll see, pal. Now let's go home and get you something to eat. You must be starving.
Gary: [groans] Meow.
[Everyone is sleeping until SpongeBob's foghorn alarm wakes them up]
Squidward: SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob, what are you doing in my house?!
SpongeBob: I came to make sure you don't oversleep and miss work.
Squidward: Oh gee, SpongeBob, that's very thoughtful of you.
SpongeBob: My pleasure, Squidward. That's what good neighbors are for.
Squidward: You did overlook one teensy little detail, however.
SpongeBob: What's that, Squidward?
Squidward: (provoked) IT'S SUNDAY! [angrily kicks SpongeBob out of his house] A good neighbor doesn't bother me on Sunday!
SpongeBob: Sunday? No wonder Squidward's grumpy. He forgets his Sunday papers. This'll show Squidward I'm a good neighbor. I'll bring it to him. [breaks the string that holds the paper together] Man this is heavy. [bumps into Patrick] Oh, pardon me.
Patrick: Hey, watch where you're going. [screams] Newspaper monster!
SpongeBob: [throws paper in the air, screaming] Monster! [both scream and run around]
Squidward: Will you two nincompoops kindly quiet down?! I am not going to let them ruin the rest of my Sunday. [hums] My Sunday relaxation kit. [reaches into box] Let's see…pillow. [puts pillow on end of couch] Placed ever so for slight foot elevation. Flower--to brighten the room. Flower fragrance. [sprays fragrance on flower. The flower dies] Ah, and the final touch. [dials on phone] Yes, I'd like to order the Sunday special. Yes, pedicure and foot massage house call, that is correct. See you at 4 my good man. [hangs up phone] This is gonna be a heavenly day. Oh, I almost forgot. [grabs a box] Bon-bons. Hello there, heaven's little wonder. Take me on a chocolate vacation. [SpongeBob & Patrick raise up from behind the couch making noises. Squidward spits out his chocolate]
SpongeBob & Patrick: By the all seeing eye, ye are worthy. We are not.
Squidward: What are you two idiots doing?
Patrick: Secret ritual.
SpongeBob: To inaugurate you as president.
Squidward: Me? President of Bikini Bottom? I knew the people would come to their senses.
Patrick: No, silly. Not the president of Bikini Bottom. Even better.
Squidward: Better?
SpongeBob: You're the president of 'The Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge'.
Squidward: The what? Is this some stupid club you two made up? [SpongeBob & Patrick laugh]
Patrick: Maybe. [both laugh]
SpongeBob: It's a secret. [both laugh]
Squidward: Fine. As my first presidential decree, why don't you, uhh, go out and paint all the leaves on the trees to make the neighborhood look nicer? [pushing SpongeBob & Patrick out the door] Now out, out, out, out, out, out. That'll keep them busy for a few Sundays. [when he closes the door, SpongeBob & Patrick appear from inside]
SpongeBob: What colors should we paint the laves, your presidentialocity?
Squidward: Polka dots! Now don't bother me anymore.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Wow. Polka dots.
Patrick: Our new president is a genius.
SpongeBob: Yeah. [both laugh]
SpongeBob & Patrick: See ya later, Squidward.
SpongeBob: [now outside, a red paint can drops on the ground] Whenever you're ready, Patrick.
Patrick: [Patrick unscrews SpongeBob's hat which turns out to be a screw] Hold still, buddy. [pours the red paint inside SpongeBob's hole. When he is done, he throws the can away and ends up hitting an elderly citizen riding a bike. Patrick screws the hat back in]
SpongeBob: Okay, Pat, gimme a quick shake.
Patrick: Okie dokie. [Patrick shakes SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Okay! I'm ready! [Patrick grabs SpongeBob's arm and uses it like a slot machine. Drops of red paint come shooting out SpongeBob's holes and onto trees] Hey, that worked perfectly. C'mon, good neighbor Patrick, let's paint the town polka dot.
Squidward: [clock on wall is ringing noon] Oh, no. It's already noon. I will be darned if I let those morons eat up anymore of my valuable Sunday.
SpongeBob & Patrick: [outside one of Squidward's windows singing] Good neighbors are we. La-la-la-la-la-la.
Squidward: What's going on out there?
SpongeBob: Hi, president Squidward. Almost done painting the- [Patrick pulls on SpongeBob's arm which makes the paint shoot out his holes and all over Squidward's face and in his eyes]
Squidward: [screams] My eyes! [runs around bumping into stuff. Runs outside and in front of a car]
Debbie Rechid: Look out! [car slams on brakes and stops in front of Squidward]
Ralph: Oh, you poor man.
Debbie: You must be very sick! Let us take you to the hospital.
Squidward: No really, I'm fine. Please, I…no, uhh… [car drives off]
SpongeBob & Patrick: See ya later, neighbor!
Patrick: It is a lovely day for a ride in the country.
SpongeBob: Yeah, our president sure knows how to live. [later] I'd like to call this meeting of the good neighbor lodge to order. Let's begin with role call: Patrick. [Patrick is snoring] OK…Squidward? [Squidward's chair is empty] Squidward? Squidward, you home?
Patrick: Did you find him, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Nope. I guess he's still on his Sunday drive.
Patrick: Or maybe he's on a secret mission.
SpongeBob: I hope he's not in danger.
Patrick: Danger?!
SpongeBob: As members of the good neighbor lodge, we are sworn to protect our president from danger.
Harold (red fish): Excuse me? Somebody ordered a relaxing pedicure and foot massage? The Sunday special?
SpongeBob: Brother Star, we'd better check this guy out. Make sure he's safe for Squidward.
Squidward: At least I still have my Sunday pedicure to look forward to. [SpongeBob & Patrick are laughing inside Squidward's house. Squidward opens his front door] What are you two doing in my house?
SpongeBob: We're checking to make sure this guy really is a certified foot masseur and not some kind of assassin.
Patrick: I say he checks out a-ok.
SpongeBob: Squidward, have you ever seen more lovely French tips? [shows foot with long toenails]
Squidward: French tips, huh? [pushes SpongeBob's chair to the side] Alright, pal, make with the foot massage, pronto!
Harold (red fish): Uh-oh. Sorry. Your hour's up.
Squidward: [He angrily twitches his eye. As SpongeBob continues wiggling his toes, he furious turns red and makes way toward the front door] Alright, you two! Out! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk out] And don't even think about dragging your empty skulls around here for the rest of the day. Or tomorrow, or next week.
SpongeBob: Squidward, does that include…
Squidward: [angrily screams] 'Yes, it does! [furiously slams door]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, do you think Squidward was trying to tell us something?
Squidward: [angrily busts head through the door, exploding] Yes, I was! You call yourselves good neighbors?! You're the worst neighbors ever! [deep breath] You don't deserve to wear those fezzes! [furiously takes SpongeBob and Patrick's fezzes and angrily stomps them into the ground]
SpongeBob: Gee, Pat, maybe President Squidward's right.
Patrick: Yeah, I guess we aren't good neighbors after all.
Squidward: [furiously explodes once again] No, you aren't! You're horrible neighbors! [he angrily hyperventilates] And stop calling me president!
SpongeBob: C'mon, let's go. [SpongeBob and Patrick sadly walk away]
Squidward: There are only 3 hours of my Sunday left. They took it all away. I didn't even get to read the Sunday paper. [notices pile of paper on ground with a note on it]
SpongeBob: ['Here's Your Sunday Paper Squidward. Enjoy. Love, SpongeBob.'.]
[Squidward steams up furiously, kicks the paper into the air, then growls like a dog. Then he takes a paper off his head.]
Squidward: Good neighbors my right. [reads paper] Hello? "Keep Out Intruders For Good! New Security System 5000. Free Installation" [Squidward does an evil laugh. Later, he has the security system built in and turned on]
Security System: System Activated.
Squidward: That oughta do it. Let's see those imbeciles try to get in here now.
SpongeBob: [he with Patrick, with their fezzes back on, walk up to Squidward] President Squidward?
Squidward: [screams] What the…?!
SpongeBob: We hereby present you with this delicious cake.
Squidward: [reads writing on cake] "Sorry for bugging you so much"? What the…? Security system, help! Intruder alert! Intruder alert! What's the matter with you?!
Security System: No threat detected.
Squidward: [angry, banging on security system] Grrr! You infernal contraption! I'm gonna ship you off to the scrap heap you came from!
Security System: Threat detected. [The system shoots a laser at Squidward which makes SpongeBob & Patrick's cake fly into the air and land on the system, causing it to go haywire.]
Squidward: What's going on?
Security System: Threat detected. Code red! Code red!
SpongeBob: [laughing as fireworks are shooting out all over Squidward's house] It's like a carnival ride.
Squidward: [running around] Run for your lives! [Squidward's house suddenly grows legs and arms and stands up. Then grabs Squidward from inside] What the? What are you doing?![Squidward's house kicks him into the air and walks off.] I only have half an hour of me time left, and the idiots took my house. Which means those boobs aren't around to bug me. Ooh, just what I've been waiting for. [laughs hysterically] I am gonna relax if it kills me.
[Meanwhile, Squidward's house is on a rampage.]
Army: Fire! [The tank fires a missile at the house, but the house catches the missile and flicks it away. Then the house grabs the tank and squishes it.]
Patrick: Wow. Squidward's house is destroying the neighborhood.
SpongeBob: We gotta turn this thing off. [turns on a light switch] Nope, not it.
Patrick: [flushes the toilet] Nope.
SpongeBob: [turns on the fan] Nope.
Patrick: [pushes the toasted button down] That's not it, either.
Squidward: [still resting] This Sunday relaxation really hits the spot. [house stands right above Squidward]
SpongeBob: Hmmm, where to look. [notices an "off button" on the wall] Hmmm, this off button seems suspicious. [pushes button and house sits on top of Squidward and goes back to normal] We did it, Patrick! [Squidward busts through from beneath the floor] President Squidward?
Squidward: No-no, don't say anything anymore. This was all my fault. I was the one who wanted to relax on Sunday. Now if you'll be so kind to leave so that I can get ready for work tomorrow.
SpongeBob: Mr. President-
Squidward: Shush.
SpongeBob: But we just wanted to…
Squidward: [yells in their faces angrily] Get out of my house! Huh?
[As soon as SpongeBob and Patrick flee from Squidward, a whole crowd and two police boats appear outside Squidward's house.]
Scooter: There he is!
Green Fish: Are you the owner of this house?
Squidward: Yes! Yes, I am!
Green Fish: Then on behalf of the citizens of Bikini Bottom, [the angry fish hands him a warrant] I present you with this summons to pay for the destruction of our town. You'll be doing community service every Sunday for the rest of your life.
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, you got one of those, too? [SpongeBob & Patrick walk up with a summons in their hands] This'll be great. The three of us cleaning up Bikini Bottom. Well, see ya next Sunday, president Squidward.
[Squidward twitches, ready for another explosion.]
SpongeBob: Wait for it... [clock changes to 8:00. SpongeBob punches in then jumps in the air. The scene pauses him in mid-air]
Automated Voice: On Time Percentage: 100%. [the scene starts again. Squidward walks up to the time clock]
Squidward: Another day, another migraine. Heh, heh, mi... [scene pauses again]
Automated Voice: On Time Percentage: 12%. [the screen un-pauses]
Squidward: ...graine. Heh, heh, heh.
SpongeBob: Ahh, isn't it great working at the Krusty Krab, Squidward? Huh? Isn't it? Working here?
Squidward: Yeah, great.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Aww, yeah.
Squidward: [getting annoyed] Yes!
SpongeBob: Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest. [laughs. SpongeBob walks out with a bag and a long, pointy tool] Litter. [picks up trash] Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper? [laughs] Kids these days. [another piece of trash falls to the ground next to him. He gasps and he picks up the trash] I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now. [more trash keeps falling to the ground around him and he picks them up quickly. He breathes, exhausted, as one more piece of litter falls down attached to a parachute. He finally snaps] Where is all this litter coming from?! [SpongeBob notices someone tossing trash out of a car] Not on my watch. [walks up to the car] Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter.
Strangler: Heh, what're you gonna do, call the police? [police arrive]
SpongeBob: Yes. [police begin to handcuff the Strangler. They walk past him in single-file and continue cuffing him]
Squidward: How's it going, Lieutenant?
SpongeBob: Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there saved room for his just desserts. [laughs] Yeah, just desserts.
Squidward: Whatever. Huh? [notices the Strangler] SpongeBob, don't you know who that is?
SpongeBob: Who?
Squidward: That's the Tattletale Strangler.
SpongeBob: Who?
Squidward: The Tattletale Strangler! [shows SpongeBob a 'WANTED' poster of the Strangler] He's promised to strangle anyone who turns him in! [Strangler growls. SpongeBob and Squidward are scared]
SpongeBob: He seems kind of angry with us, eh, Squidward? [Squidward's gone] Squidward? Squidward?
Officer Johnson: You're gonna do time, Strangler. Hard time. [SpongeBob walks up to the police]
SpongeBob: Hi, officers. So, he's going to jail, right?
Officer Nancy: Who, Strangler?
SpongeBob: Yeah, Strangler.
Officer Nancy: Oh, yeah, he's going to jail for a long time. [Strangler draws on the back of the driver's seat headrest, and flips it to reveal an exact likeness of SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Hey, that looks like me! [Strangler growls and attacks the headrest, "killing" the SpongeBob drawing, and chuckles evilly. SpongeBob screams]
Officer Nancy: Don't worry, SpongeBob. He won't be able to strangle you.
Officer Johnson: Yeah. We got him chained up real good. He'll never get away.
Officer Nancy: Oops, not again. [Strangler is gone, with his handcuffs in his place in the car]
Officer Johnson: Yep, he got away. [SpongeBob screams then falls over]
SpongeBob: You nice officers will protect me, right?
Officer Nancy: We ain't bodyguards, kid.
Officer Johnson: Yeah, give us a call if you see him again... tattletale. [they drive off, leaving dust that makes SpongeBob cough]
SpongeBob: Those officers are right. I need a bodyguard! [runs into the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard!
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] I wasn't five-time 'Golden Claws' in the navy for nothin'. When he sees me moves, he'll be running scared. So, where is this little bully? Down at the park? The sodey shop? What does he look like, eh, boy?
SpongeBob: This would be him, Mr. Krabs. [takes out the wanted poster of The Strangler]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps in fear] The Tattletale Strangler?! [his appendages go into his body] Go away, SpongeBob! Take your death cloud with you! [scene cuts to SpongeBob showing the wanted poster to people. Shows it to Larry, who turns into a real lobster on a plate, then a construction worker who pogos off on his jackhammer, and some guys at the Tough Tavern who run off, some screaming "HOLD ME! HOLD ME!", leaving SpongeBob distraught]
SpongeBob: [at the bus stop] Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard. [Strangler sits on a bench reading a newspaper]
Strangler: Bodyguard, huh? I might be able to help you out. [SpongeBob walks over]
SpongeBob: You don't understand, mister. I need protection from the scariest guy in town. Here's his picture. [holds up the wanted poster. The Strangler reveals himself wearing a fake mustache]
Strangler: Heh heh, he doesn't look so tough.
SpongeBob: I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty. [Strangler shows his filthy hands and laughs. Before the Strangler starts to strangle SpongeBob, a bus stops next to them and the Strangler puts his hands behind his back and smiles, as the bus drives off]
Strangler: Huh? Uh-oh. Uh, there's too many witnesses around here. [walks up to SpongeBob] Listen, kid. I could be your bodyguard. Here's my card. [Shows SpongeBob his drawn-over fake ID card]
SpongeBob: Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next? [a five cent sticker is hanging from the Strangler's fake mustache]
Strangler: Well, the maniac could be anywhere, wearing a disguise. He could be that old man. [he points to an old man with a walker] Or that baby. [points to a baby in a stroller]
SpongeBob: Or that pebble. [points to a small rock on the ground] Or that stick. [points to a stick on the ground] Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium. [points to a white piece of paper]
Strangler: Huh? Uhh, that's mine. [picks it up and puts it in his pocket]
SpongeBob: Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?
Strangler: Well, I suggest we go to a nice, quiet, secluded location, uh, like behind an old dumpster or a dark alley...
SpongeBob: We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!
Strangler: Perfect. That way no one can hear you being strangled... err, I mean, uhh, protected. [laughs as the lights grow dim] Perfect. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Yes, excellent. [laughs with the Strangler until the lights turn on again] Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands.
Strangler: Uhh, okay, but let's make it quick.
SpongeBob: Quick is my middle name. [scene cuts to the grocery store] Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard?
Strangler: Whatever gets us to your house quicker.
SpongeBob: I'll take both! [scene cuts to 'Dry Cleaning While-U-Wait']
Dry Cleaner: Here you go, Mr. SquarePants. [he hands him his clothes]
SpongeBob: Hmmm.
Dry Cleaner: Is there something wrong?
SpongeBob: I'm not sure if these are my pants. [Strangler groans. Scene cuts to the perfume store where SpongeBob sprays some perfume on his wrist and holds it up to the Strangler] How about this one, bodyguard? Too overbearing?
Strangler: Can we just go to your house?! [scene cuts to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Here we are. SquarePants Manor. Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have.
Strangler: All right, enough of the sappy talk! Open the door so I can strangle you... I mean, uhh, choke you... I mean, uhh, crush your windpipe... gah, I mean...
SpongeBob: Protect me?
Strangler: Thanks.
SpongeBob: Don't mention it, Strangler. [gasps] I mean, bodyguard. Now where'd I put my key? [searches his pocket for the key as the Strangler gets angry]
Narrator: Twenty minutes later... [SpongeBob is still searching for his key. The Strangler gets even more angry]
SpongeBob: Well, I can't find 'em. You wanna take a look?
Strangler: Oh, forget the key! Let's climb through this window. [struggles reaching for the window] I can't reach it. Do you think you could hop up on my shoulders, kid? [SpongeBob is wearing cleats]
SpongeBob: Sure. With these spiky cleats, anything is possible. [jumps onto the Strangler] Ya.
Strangler: Cleats?! [SpongeBob's feet land on the Strangler's eyeballs. The Strangler screams in pain] Get your feet out of my eye sockets! [SpongeBob starts tugging at his legs]
SpongeBob: I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas! [Strangler runs around in pain]
Narrator: Six hours later... [Strangler is still running around until he pulls SpongeBob's feet out of his eyes. Scene cuts to the Strangler with bandages on his eyes]
SpongeBob: Don't be mad, bodyguard. Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside. [The Strangler's eyes open widely. The Strangler growls in anger and a nuclear explosion comes out of his head] There you are, you little rascal. Now, to put the key in the lock, which should activate the tumblers, thus opening the door. [Strangler sneaks up behind SpongeBob ready to strangle him. SpongeBob opens the door and walks in] Step inside...
Strangler: [closes the door] Close the door...
SpongeBob: Well, here we are.
Strangler: I've finally got you all alone! [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: I know, isn't it great? [laughs. Strangler picks up SpongeBob] Ooh.
Strangler: Now, you're gonna get yours... tattletale! [lights turn on]
All of SpongeBob's friends: Surprise! [all of SpongeBob's friends are in his house cheering. They drop a sign that says 'Congratulations, SpongeBob! 100% On Time!']
SpongeBob: A surprise party to celebrate my perfect on-time percentage at work? [Strangler nervously places his hands behind his back] Oh, how'd you guys know?
Patrick: It's on the invitations you sent us. [holds an invitation up] Let's boogie! [everyone parties. The Strangler sits down in SpongeBob's chair. Scene cuts to the end of the party]
SpongeBob: Bye, everybody, thanks for coming! Bye Mr. Krabs, bye Plankton, bye Sandy, bye Larry, bye Pearl, bye Mrs. Puff, bye Squidward, bye, eh, the rest. [everyone else leaves and he walks back into the house and laughs] Ahh, alone at last.
Strangler: [wakes up] What? Huh? Huh? What? Huh? [SpongeBob closes the door] So, we're all alone now?
SpongeBob: Just you, me, and the floorboards. [Strangler and SpongeBob begin laughing again] Yeah. [there's a knock on the door. SpongeBob opens it]
All: Happy birthday, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: How did you guys know today is my birthday?
Patrick: We just do what the invitations say. Let's boogie some more! [everyone parties again and the Strangler walks back to SpongeBob's chair. Scene cuts to the end of the party]
SpongeBob: Thanks for coming! [closes the door. Laughs] Alone again.
Strangler: Is it true? Everybody's gone?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Strangler: No, no more parties today? You got everything you need now? Nobody's left? We're completely alone?
SpongeBob: Oh yeah.
Strangler: In that case... [laughs evilly until Patrick appears out of nowhere]
Patrick: Great parties, huh?
Strangler: Oh... sorry, Tubby, you've gotta go. [carries Patrick away]
SpongeBob: Wait! We can trust Patrick. He's my best friend.
Strangler: Well, I can't take any chances. For all we know, he could be the Strangler.
Patrick: I'm the Strangler? Oh, I should've known! I gotta turn myself in! [runs and breaks through the wall]
SpongeBob: So, Patrick's the Strangler. Gee, you think you know a guy.
Strangler: [growls] HE’S NOT THE STRANGLER!!!!!!
SpongeBob: He's not?
Strangler: [rips off his fake mustache] I AM!!!!
SpongeBob: Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream?
Strangler: Oh, It's a fake, you idiot!! I bought it at the party store!! [everyone comes back inside]
Squidward: Did someone say 'party'? [Strangler screams and runs out through the wall]
Strangler: I can't take it!
SpongeBob: [runs after him] Wait, bodyguard, I need protection! [Strangler gets into a taxi]
Strangler: Step on it! I'm being chased by a maniac! [SpongeBob chases after the taxi]
SpongeBob: I'm not safe! Come back! [taxi goes to the Bikini Bottom Airport and an airplane takes off]
Strangler: Finally, away from that guy.
SpongeBob: [on the airplane a row behind Strangler] Good idea, bodyguard. They’ll never find us up here. [Strangler jumps out of the plane screaming, he opens his parachute, but it is actually SpongeBob] Good thinking, bodyguard. The Strangler could have been on that plane. [Strangler takes out a giant pair of scissors and cuts the strings off the SpongeBob parachute and plummets right into the Bikini Bottom Police Station jail. SpongeBob comes running up to him] Bodyguard, bodyguard!
Strangler: Look, kid... I'm not your bodyguard! [cries] I'm the Strangler! See?! [looks toward his 'WANTED' poster on the wall]
SpongeBob: [gasps] The Strangler! [police officers walk up]
Officer Nancy: Good work, SpongeBob. You put the Strangler behind bars.
Strangler: At least I'm safe from that yellow idiot.
Patrick: Hey, Mac, [Strangler turns and sees Patrick in the cell with him] what're you in for?
[Open on the Krusty Krab. The customers are eating food, Mr. Krabs is painting a picture and Squidward is manning the cash register.]
Mr. Krabs: Finished! At last. [Shows the picture to Squidward and SpongeBob, who is now at the chef's window] What do you boys think of my masterpiece?
SpongeBob: [reading the sign] New business hours: 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Squidward: What?! That is totally unfair!
SpongeBob: Squidward's right. That's totally unfair! Couldn't we get to work earlier than 6:00 a.m.? Like 5:30 a.m.? Or 5:00 a.m.? Or 4:00 a.m.? Or-- [Squidward zips up the chef's window]
Squidward: Zip it! [Mr. Krabs places the sign on the front window. He stares out of the window and notices something surprising from across the street]
Mr. Krabs: What the...? [The Chum Bucket now displays a sign in front saying that it is "now open 23 hours"] The Chum Bucket open 23 hours?! So, that little piece of flotsam Plankton thinks he can stay open longer than me, does he? [A customer walks up to him, tray in hand]
Fish: Sure. I don't know. Why not?
Mr. Krabs: Well, he's wrong!
Fish: Oh, okay. Sure.
Mr. Krabs: As of now, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours! [SpongeBob's head bursts through the wall, in the place where the chef's window used to be]
SpongeBob: Did you hear that, Squidward? We get to keep working and working and working without ever having to go home! I've got to pinch myself, because I must be dreaming. [SpongeBob exits the punctured hole in the wall and stands flat on the floor. He starts pinching himself twice, then yells in pain. He pinches himself again and yells again, then does it four more times. After a brief pause, he pinches himself yet again] Well, I'm not dreaming. [Switch to a telescope view of the front window of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs walks up to the sign and amends it to read, Open 24 hours!]
Plankton: [behind the telescope] Open 24 hours, eh? I knew he couldn't resist staying open later than me. [He starts walking into the Chum Bucket] My evil plan is working perfectly. He'll run his employees into the ground, and when SpongeBob's mind finally cracks from exhaustion, I'll get him to tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula! [Laughs evilly. He notices after a while that his computer wife, Karen is not laughing with him] Why aren't you laughing?
Karen: I've heard this joke before. [Scene switches to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is standing near the cash register with a cowbell and beater in his hands]
Mr. Krabs: All right, everybody. The Krusty Krab is entering day 3 of non-stop service! Let's give it up for day 3! [The camera shows the customers of the Krusty Krab eating their food and not being swayed by Mr. Krabs' excitement] Yee haw! Day 3!
SpongeBob: [inside the kitchen, holding a Krabby patty] Krabby Patty, I don't care if we have to stay open until the day after the end of time. As long as I am with you, I am complete. [Bubbles fill the screen as the episode transitions to the outside of the Krusty Krab. It then cuts to the inside, where Mr. Krabs still is holding the cowbell]
Mr. Krabs: Day 10 of non-stop service!
Squidward: [exhausted] Mr. Krabs, can I go home yet?
Mr. Krabs: No one goes home!
Squidward: [points to the bags under his eyes] Look at these bags under my eyes; even my bags have bags! [The camera shows a closely detailed picture of Squidward's drowsy eyes, and a lady screams.]
Mr. Krabs: Quit your bellyaching, Squidward; you don't hear SpongeBob complaining, do you?
SpongeBob: [grilling hamburgers in the kitchen]  K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y, says I. 
Mr. Krabs: You could learn a few things from that boy.
Squidward: [through his teeth] Mr. Krabs, he is not normal. [SpongeBob starts kissing a Krabby Patty]
Mr. Krabs: All right, you can sit down for five minutes. Then it's back to work. [Squidward drops over and starts snoring. Plankton, wearing a tight black suit, descends from a rope on the wall and monitors at SpongeBob]
Plankton: Drats! He's not collapsing from exhaustion! But with a little more pressure, the sponge will crack like an egg [clenches fist], and I'll be there to feast on the goo of his shattered psyche. [Slurps and then does an evil laugh. Mr. Krabs notices Plankton, but since he is tiny, black and suspending from a coil, he believes Plankton is a small insect]
Mr. Krabs: Eww! A spider bug. [Mr. Krabs squishes him and the scene changes to the Chum Bucket a while later. Plankton is on the phone, ordering an item from the Krusty Krab]
Plankton: Come on! [Mr. Krabs finally picks up on the other line]
Mr. Krabs: Krusty Krab! The restaurant that never closes. Would you like to place an order? [We hear a muffled sound from Mr. Krabs' phone] 10,000 Krabby Patties?! We'll start your order right away, Mr...uh, uh...What was that name again? [Muffles coming from the phone. Mr. Krabs writes his information on a piece of paper] Uh huh...Peter Lankton. Wait a minute, this isn't some kind of prank, is it?
Plankton: Eh...no.
Mr. Krabs: Good! We'll call you when it's ready, Mr. Lankton. [Mr. Krabs bursts through the kitchen door, and starts yelling orders at SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Kick it into high gear! We've got a big order! [Clutches SpongeBob, who is staring into space] I'm counting on you, boy! I need you to raise that spatular! [SpongeBob does so, enthusiastically] Yeah! And I need you to say, "Team Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob: Team Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: That's me boy! Now, make me 10,000 Krabby Patties. [SpongeBob's eyes swell up as Mr. Krabs walks away] And no breaks!
SpongeBob: [Ecstatic, giggles] Did you hear that, spatula? You, me and 10,000 Krabby Patties. And the best part? No breaks! [Pinches himself] Wow! [Cut to a view of the ocean with a small island with some palm trees in the background]
Mr. Krabs: Day 15! Give it up for day 15! [floats by as he hits the bell]
SpongeBob: K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y... [floats by, flipping three of six patties on the grill, as the setting transforms into the nighttime. Plankton floats by as the setting transforms into the daytime. Plankton laughs menacingly. SpongeBob floats by, putting mustard on one of four unfinished patties]
SpongeBob: 1,322...
Mr. Krabs: Day 23! Give it up for day 23! [floats by as the setting transforms into the nighttime. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob continue floating by as the setting changes from day to night and vice versa]
SpongeBob: 6,654...
Mr. Krabs: Day 30!
SpongeBob: 7,121... [Plankton floats by now. He laughs menacingly. Patty items float by]
Mr. Krabs: Day...35...! [floating by as the setting transforms into the nighttime. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob continue floating by as the setting changes from day to night and vice versa]
SpongeBob: 8,659... [floats by]
Old Man Jenkins: Wait, what's going on? Whoa, whoa! [floats by, confusedly. The scene switches back to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs appears extremely tired]
Mr. Krabs: Day... [record scratch] anyone know how many days it's been? I've lost track.
Squidward: [Breathing heavily next to a pile of Krabby Patties] 43...! [Gasps, as the top of his head expands and shrinks. SpongeBob places a tray of food items on the chef's window and then shoves them off. He does the same again for a smelly boot]
Mr. Krabs: What the flimflam?! [Enters the kitchen and notices SpongeBob looking like a wreck] What are you doing in here, boy? You're wasting all me food. [SpongeBob does not answer him] Boy? [SpongeBob starts fighting the air with his spatula. Mr. Krabs hits him on the back of his head]
SpongeBob: [Drowsily] Oh, hey, Mr. Krabs. When did you get here?
Mr. Krabs: Boy, I'm worried that... [Mr. Krabs turns into a giant talking Krabby Patty] Got it?
SpongeBob: [wiping his eyes] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. Could you run that by me again?
Mr. Krabs: Sure, I said I'm worried that... [He turns into a Krabby Patty again. He turns back into himself after he stops talking]
SpongeBob: That's what I thought you said. Now, let me offer this as a rebuttal: [he starts screaming and throwing his hands in the air. He hides in the corner, waving his spatula at Mr. Krabs] Stay back! I'm warning you!
Mr. Krabs: [Starts walking towards SpongeBob] All right. Now you're just acting silly. I want you to... [Mr. Krabs turns into a Krabby Patty again]
SpongeBob: No, don't eat me! I'm too chewy! [Screams and runs outside the kitchen, where his eyes bulge as he notices the customers are now Krabby Patties] Holy shrimp! They're everywhere! [Runs screaming and knocks into a Krabby Patty, falling]
Krabby Patty: [looking at him] What?
SpongeBob: [Running and screaming. He starts screaming at two Krabby Patties sitting at a table, then one going to the bathroom and then screaming and pointing at Tom.]
Sally: I told you that shirt was hideous. [SpongeBob screams again as Mr. Krabs grabs him and pulls him into the kitchen, while SpongeBob is digging his nails into the floor]
SpongeBob: No, no! I want to live! [He enters the kitchen, but bursts the door open] I want to live [He's dragged back inside. The camera shows Squidward, exhausted]
SpongeBob: [inside the kitchen] Mr. Krabs, what's going on? Everywhere I look, I see killer Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs: [patting SpongeBob's head] There, there. I'm sure it's nothing that getting back to work won't solve. Here's your Spatular. [Hands SpongeBob his spatula]
SpongeBob: [repeating] Spatular.
Mr. Krabs: [showing SpongeBob his grill] and here's the grill.
SpongeBob: [repeating] Grill.
Mr. Krabs: [Showing SpongeBob some patties in his hands] and here are some fresh Krabby... [SpongeBob starts screaming again. When Mr. Krabs pulls the patties away, SpongeBob's scream lessens. He pulls the patties out in front of him and continues pushing and pulling them forward]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, there may be a problem after all.
SpongeBob: What does this mean?
Mr Krabs: It means there's something wrong with your head. Look, I think maybe you should see a professional.
SpongeBob: Wrestler?
Mr. Krabs: No, a psychiatrist.
SpongeBob: Oh, but where am I going to find a psychiatrist? [A paper airplane hits him in the head] Ow! [Plankton is at the chef's window and then drops down. SpongeBob starts reading the paper] Hey, look at this! "Dr. Peter Lankton: Psychiatrist. Specializing in Krabby Patty phobias". Gosh, I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. Wouldn't I have to miss work if I went to see... [Mr. Krabs holds up a patty in front of SpongeBob's face. SpongeBob points and screams at it, then runs off. The scene switches to SpongeBob, paper in his hand, finding out where the psychiatric center is. SpongeBob looks up] Well, this looks like the place. [It is the Chum Bucket with the sign "Dr. P. Lankton Psychiatrist" on it. SpongeBob enters, looking for the psychiatrist] Hello? Doctor?
Plankton: Come in, Mr. SquarePants. Please have a seat on the couch. [SpongeBob sits on the couch. He turns his chair around so that we can see Plankton wearing a costume and beard] Now... [chuckles] Let's unload all that harmful information in your little yellow head.
SpongeBob: You're a bit smaller than I imagined, doctor, but I guess that's why they call you shrink [laughs]. Do you think there's hope for me, doctor?
Plankton: Hope? Hope!? When I get my hands on that formula, there won't be any hope for any of you! [Laughs, but then clears his throat] Yeah, I mean, you'll be cured in no time.
SpongeBob: Oh, good.
Plankton: Let's start with a simple exercise.
SpongeBob: Jumping jacks?
Plankton: I want you to close your eyes. [SpongeBob lightly closes his eyes] Tighter [he closes his eyes tighter] Tighter [Tightens them even more, until the rip off] Too tight! Now, tell me what you see?
SpongeBob: I see giant Krabby Patties!
Plankton: Good, and what are they made of? [He starts recording on a voice recorder]
SpongeBob: Hatred!
Plankton: No, I mean ingredients. What are the stinking ingredients?!
SpongeBob: They're coming for me. No! No! No! Stay back! [He produces a grand piano from nowhere and somehow holds it threateningly in the air]
Plankton: Wait, where'd you get that piano? [SpongeBob smashes Plankton with the piano. He groans. Later, he continues his psychology] We're trying something else. I'm going to say a word and I want you to say the first word that pops into your head. Ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Plankton: Work.
SpongeBob: Work.
Plankton: Spatula.
SpongeBob: Spatula.
Plankton: Bun.
SpongeBob: Bun.
Plankton: See, the key is to say something different to what I say.
SpongeBob: Oh, okay, I've got it.
Plankton: Potato.
SpongeBob: Potahto.
Plankton: Tomato.
SpongeBob: Tomahto. [Scene switches to SpongeBob kneeling on the floor looking at various cards]
Plankton: I've laid out some words on cards here. These words are common kitchen ingredients. I want you to arrange them in any order you choose. It could be a poem or a secret formula. I don't know… oh, yes! A secret formula. Good, let's do that.
SpongeBob: Um, you're making me nervous.
Plankton: Oh, okay. [Walks to and sits on his chair] I'll be over here, then.
SpongeBob: I'm finished! [Plankton gets up and walks to SpongeBob] I've arranged them into a piano. [The piano falls on Plankton]
Plankton: Since your mind has been resistant to every mental technique so far, I'm forced to resort to my most powerful method of curing you.
SpongeBob: Fiber?
Plankton: No, hypnosis.
SpongeBob: Hypnosis?!
Plankton: [holds a ticking watch in front of him] Now, keep your eyes on this watch. [shakes it slowly] When I count to three, you will fall into a deep sleep. 1...uh, 2...uh, 3. [SpongeBob falls asleep and begins snoring very loudly] I can't believe it worked. Now, when I snap my fingers, you will awake and tell me the formula. [Snaps fingers, but SpongeBob continues snoring loudly. He snaps a couple more times] Hey, wake up! [He clashes cymbals, blows a trumpet and beats on drums, but SpongeBob continues snoring, even louder than the sounds] Hmm, what else is loud and obnoxious? [He holds a loud ringing cell phone up to his ear, but SpongeBob's snoring is even louder] Why won't you wake up?!
[We peer into SpongeBob's dream. In it, he is chasing jellyfish, but then gets caught in a fishnet by a huge Krabby Patty, who then eats him. Inside the Krabby Patty, SpongeBob looks around in the dark]
SpongeBob: Where am I? [Lights turn on and he is lying in his bed in his home. The door to his room opens and a huge Krabby Patty walks in]
Krabby Patty: Hey, SpongeBob. I heard your brain was sick, so I brought you this cookie pizza. [Hands SpongeBob a cookie pizza]
SpongeBob: Gee, thanks!
Krabby Patty: And here's some chocolate milk. [Hands SpongeBob a glass of chocolate milk]
SpongeBob: The king of flavored dairy drinks! [He drinks it quickly] Oh, Krabby Patty, I'm so glad we're friends again.
Krabby Patty: Just remember, SpongeBob, I'll always be with you right here [points to a part of SpongeBob's stomach] .
SpongeBob: In my heart?
Krabby Patty: Actually, in your arteries. Now, do me a favor and wake up. Wake up.
Plankton: [In real life, shouting into a loudspeaker] Wake up!
SpongeBob: [wakes up, yawning] It worked! I'm cured!
Plankton: But what about the formula?
SpongeBob: Oh, you're right! I'd better get back to work! [SpongeBob runs away, towards the Krusty Krab] Thanks for everything, doc!
Plankton: [yelling] No! It's a lie! Therapy doesn't really work! You're still sick! Very, very sick! [Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is flipping burgers normally]
Mr. Krabs: Good to see you're brain's all fixed, boy.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can safely say, "No more 24 hour shifts", because 23 hours will be plenty! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs...! [SpongeBob then starts laughing]
Mr. Krabs: No, seriously. Get back to work!
Patrick: Best Friends Day. Best Friends Day. Best Friends Day. Best Friends Day. [giggling]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Happy Best Friend... whoa.
Patrick: This chewing gum is my most beloved possession, and I'm giving it to my bestest friend, on Best Friends Day.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I am truly honored and... [cries]
Patrick: What's wrong, buddy?
SpongeBob: You got me such an amazing gift, and all I got you was...that. [a robot comes out]
Robo 2.1: Greetings. I am Robo 2.1, your personal robot servant. I am proficient in providing over 250,000 creature comforts. Would you care for a pastry? [shoots a pastry into Patrick's mouth]
Patrick: Yum. Sweet, hot, and juicy. SpongeBob, this is a great gift!
SpongeBob: Well, thanks for your appreciation, Patrick, but it's no giant, old, used ball of gum.
Patrick: Aww, don't be so hard on yourself, SpongeBob. I love my gift. In fact, I'll go play with it right now. Come on, Robo.
Robo 2.1: Coming, Master Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, you don't mind if I say goodbye to Gummy, do you?
SpongeBob: No, not at all.
Patrick: Thanks. Goodbye, Gummy. You be good to SpongeBob, you hear? [pokes his finger in the ball of gum and it squirts out water on Patrick] I love you, too, Gummy. [hugs it] Well, he's all yours.
SpongeBob: O, majestic and much masticated Gummy, although I am not worthy to be in your presence, may my humble abode please you. [struggles to push the giant ball of gum in his house. Breaks his arms in half in the process] Oh, you sure are a big boy, aren't you? Ooh. Hey, I know how to handle this. With a little karate! Hyah! [rolls the giant ball of gum into his pineapple. Crawls out using his legs] Ooh. Oh, Gummy, what a beautiful centerpiece you make. With your dirty sock and used toothbrush, flies, and moldy pizza. [sniffs and almost barfs] Get a hold of yourself, SpongeBob. It's not so bad. After all, it is a gift from Patrick. [a pair of underwear come out of the gum slithers onto SpongeBob's cringing face]
Underwear: [raspy and demonic] You're...not Patrick. [SpongeBob screams and runs into another room]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Patrick, but your gift has got to go! [cut to SpongeBob taking the ball of gum out of the garage and holds it up] Goodbye, stink ball. See ya never! [throws it on top of his garbage can]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, whatcha doing? [Robo is carrying Patrick on a mattress]
Robo 2.1: It appears that he is throwing Gummy away.
Patrick: What? Is that true?
SpongeBob: No way, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, how do you explain this? [points to Gummy on the garbage can]
SpongeBob: Well, you see, I liked Gummy and I decided to dress him up. [puts the garbage can top on Gummy] Isn't this a cute look?
Patrick: Hmmm. Bold yet understated. Brilliant idea, SpongeBob. Keep up the good work. Come on, Robo, let's find more belly button lint. [cut to SpongeBob digging a giant hole]
Patrick: Yeah, he does look rather dashing from this angle. Be that as it may, Gummy must be displayed properly and proudly. And I know just the place. [puts Gummy above SpongeBob's door] Isn't he breathtaking? All right, SpongeBob, we got to go. I'm gonna learn how to use a fork. Right, Robo?
Robo 2.1: It will be my pleasure, master.
Patrick: By the way, your house looks a million times better. [the old sock falls from the giant ball of gum and onto SpongeBob's nose]
SpongeBob: Thanks. [cut to later] Oh, what am I going to do, Gary? It's hideous.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Wishful thinking, Gary. What burglar would want to steal that thing? [sneaks off and dresses up as a burglar] Shhh. [Gary zips him mouth and his eyes. Cut to night where SpongeBob sneaks around his house, looking back and forth at Patrick's rock to make sure he is not awake. He struggles to get into the ball of gum but does. A fish digs his way to where SpongeBob is]
Fish: Who are you? Where did you come from?
SpongeBob: Uh, up there.
Fish: Oh, thank Neptune! Hey, guys, I found a way out! Come on! [manages to get out of the ball of gum] I'm free! I'm free! I'm sugar-free! [jumps off the gum as everyone else does the same] At last! [SpongeBob gets out of the gum and tries pulling it off his house but gets launched back at the gum. Cut to the next day where Sandy is walking up to SpongeBob's house]
Sandy: [Walking by and she hears a squelching noise, it is gum] What in tarnation? [notices SpongeBob's house covered in gum] Oh my gosh! SpongeBob! SpongeBob? [knocks on his door] SpongeBob, open up!
SpongeBob: Sandy.
Sandy: Oh my gosh! How long you've been stuck there, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: All day.
Sandy: Oh, come on now, there's got to be a way. [sees a truck driving down the street] I've got an idea. [takes the gum and lassos it onto a truck. The truck slows down but the driver puts the pedal to the metal, but it's still not going anywhere] Hang on tight, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yeah, all righty.
Truck Driver: Come on, Ol' Blue! Don't you talk back to me! Do as your told! Do it! [The truck starts to slowly move] Do it! Do it! Come on now, do it! Come on! [truck splits in half. The back half hits Sandy and sends her back into the pile of gum, making it explode everywhere]
Squidward: What the...? Just let it go, Squidward. Let it go. Don't get involved, Squidward. [Squidward's house attaches itself to SpongeBob's and Squidward is sent out his window and onto the sticky gum] Of course.
Sandy: I'm okay. [SpongeBob sighs]
Patrick: What's this? SpongeBob, what have you done?
Patrick: It's-it's...it's amazing! It's like a gummy wonderland! Whee! Wow, I wish I were having this much fun. I knew you'd love it.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I have something to tell you.
Robo 2.1: Would you care for a massage, Master?
Patrick: Enough already. Sheesh. So, you were saying something, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uh, well, how can I put this?
Patrick: Aw, just come right out and... [Robo blows a fan at Patrick] Will you stop? Just stop. [Robo stops]
Squidward: Get on with it, SpongeBob!
Sandy: Wrap it up.
Patrick: Squidward? Sandy? Gee, everyone is having fun with my Gummy but me. I-I-I mean, your Gummy.
SpongeBob: [lying again] Patrick, do you miss your Gummy?
Patrick: Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: Well, it's still Best Friends Day. How would you like your Gummy back?
Patrick: Yes!
SpongeBob: It's yours, buddy. But first, you got to get us out of this.
Patrick: Oh, that's easy. [chews all the gum up, with lawnmower sounds] I told you it was easy. [tummy rumbles. He hiccups a giant ball of gum and it pops all over Bikini Bottom. Gum covers the four characters as their shapely figure] Wow! This is the best Best Friends Day ever!
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets. [gasps as he sees a blue jellyfish] Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter! A two fisted Jumper! And a gold-throated stinger!
Gold Throated Singer: La, la, la, la, la, la, la!
SpongeBob: Oh, this year's migration is gonna be a big one! [SpongeBob and Patrick are over-shadowed]
Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob? [looks up and sees a bunch of colorful jellyfish above them]
SpongeBob: Wow. This looks like a job for Ol' Reliable! [opens his case to a metal net instead of one made of bamboo sticks. He catches many jellyfish while Patrick struggles to catch one. Scene cuts to the bus stop]
SpongeBob: Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever.
Patrick: Well, I didn't catch a thing with my dumb old net. [his net breaks]
SpongeBob: Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloid netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world.
Patrick: Wow! I would kill for a net like that! You know, something small like a carrot. But not spiders, they're icky. [shudders. Scene cuts to the bus dropping off Patrick and SpongeBob on their street]
SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick.
Patrick: Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [in his bed] Ah, I love jellyfishing. [night breaks into day quickly and the foghorn alarm goes off] Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable. [realizes he doesn't have it] Ol' Reliable? [gasps] It's gone! [runs out the door in his underwear]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Oh, right. Pants.
Narrator: One pair of pants later...
SpongeBob: Patrick, Ol' Reliable has been stolen! [both scream. Scene cuts to them stapling posters saying "STOLEN! OL' RELIABLE"]
SpongeBob: Put one over there, Patrick.
Patrick: I'm all done.
SpongeBob: Maybe we should spread out a little. [newspaper ad of the "Bikini Bottom Gazette" reads "STOLEN OL' RELIABLE" on the front page]
Johnny: Flash. The jellyfish migration enters it second day of fantastic jellyfishing. We now go live to our reporter on the scene.
Perch Perkins: [in Jellyfish Fields] This year's migration is the largest in a century! I feel truly sorry for the poor saps that will miss even one minute of this remarkable event. [SpongeBob takes Perch's microphone]
SpongeBob: Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return. [Mr. Krabs sees this on TV at home and runs to Jellyfish Fields then appears on TV instantly]
Mr. Krabs: Reward? How much we talkin' about?
SpongeBob: 12 dollars and... [counts the coins] ...38 cents.
Mr. Krabs: I'm on the case. [takes SpongeBob's money and runs off screen while Perch takes back his microphone]
Perch Perkins: Guys, I know it's a slow news day, but come on. [The scene cuts to SpongeBob sitting in his chair by the phone when it rings. He picks it up.]
SpongeBob: Oh! Hello? Hello?
Patrick: SpongeBob, did you get your net back?
SpongeBob: Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!
Patrick: Oh, sorry. [hangs up. The phone rings again] Did you get your net yet?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net. [hangs up. The phone rings again]
SpongeBob: Hello?!
Patrick: SpongeBob, I found your net!
SpongeBob: What?! Really, Patrick?
Patrick: Uhh, oh, not really. I just got lonely.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever. [looks out his window and notices Patrick running around with a jellyfish net]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net. [gets in bed] Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday. [his eyes widen. Scene cuts to morning. Patrick walks up to SpongeBob's pineapple]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, did you get Ol' Reliable back yet?
SpongeBob: [sighs] No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net? [Patrick laughs then stops]
Patrick: No. [SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present.
Patrick: A present? What is it?
SpongeBob: [pulls out a bear with a microphone in its hand] It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to.
Patrick: Wow, thanks, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.
[He quickly dashes off to speak for the bear.]
SpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear: Hi! My name is Confess-A-Bear! Tell me all your secrets.
Patrick: Um, [sits on the ground] I did something recently I'm not very proud of. I didn't mean to do it. It just sort of happened.
SpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear: Oh, maybe you should talk about it.
Patrick: Well, it involves my best friend SpongeBob. I don't think he knows what happened, but it would really upset him if he found out.
SpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear: Tell Confess-A-Bear!
Patrick: I've said too much already.
SpongeBob/Confess-a-Bear: Tell Confess-A-Bear now! Now!
Patrick: Ahh! I accidentally knocked SpongeBob's toothbrush in the toilet and put it back on the counter without washing it! Confess-A-Bear? [SpongeBob runs around in the background screaming and wiping his tongue off in disgust] You're mad at me, aren't you, Confess-A-Bear? [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to Patrick's rock]
SpongeBob: Patrick, we need to talk.
Patrick: Uh, don't come in! I'm not decent! The house is a mess! There's a radiation leak!
SpongeBob: Hmmm... [walks down some stairs into Patrick's rock] Patrick, where are you? Why are the lights off?
Patrick: I'm in here. Be out in a second. [Patrick's shadow reveals himself holding a jellyfishing net]
SpongeBob: Ol' Reliable! Ah...ha.
Patrick: [Standing with his hands behind his back] Hello.
SpongeBob: What's in your hand, Patrick?
Patrick: [shows his left hand] Nothing.
SpongeBob: What's in your other hand?
Patrick: [grows another arm through his chest] Nothing in my other hand.
SpongeBob: Well, I gotta go.
Patrick: Okay, bye.
SpongeBob: Patrick wouldn't steal Ol' Reliable. Would he? [imagines Patrick from earlier]
Patrick: I would kill for a net like that! [takes out a carrot, breaks it in half, and laughs maniacally]
SpongeBob: [screams] Have I been best friends with a master thief? I must know for sure. [scene cuts to the next day] Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick: Good morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What are you going to do today, buddy?
Patrick: Eh, nothing.
SpongeBob: [puts on his Krusty Krab hat] Well, I'm off to work. See ya later, Patrick.
Patrick: Bye. [SpongeBob walks off then sneaks into a bush in the background]
SpongeBob: Now, we'll just see what sort of nothing you're really up to, Sneaky McSneakyPants. [looks through binoculars]
Narrator: Eight hours later...
SpongeBob: [still looking through binoculars] Oh, he is good. You never really know a guy until you stare at him for eight hours through high-powered binoculars. Hey, where'd he go? [Patrick is behind him]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob. What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Uh, you... what the...? What are you doing?
Patrick: Nothing. I just finished. [takes out his to-do list and crosses out 'Nothing'] Oh, hey, look. You can see where I was just standing from here. Boy, if you wanted to, you could have spied on me all day from right here. [shudder] Creepy, huh? Anyway, what are you doing with those binoculars?
SpongeBob: [yells and throws away the binoculars] I don't have any binoculars, see?
Patrick: You're acting weird.
SpongeBob: I'm not acting weird! You're acting weird! [runs off panting] You're... acting... weird!
Patrick: Okay, bye! [later, SpongeBob knocks on Patrick's rock] Hello! Who are you?
SpongeBob: [wearing a mustache. British accent] Greetings, young fellow! I am willing to pay top dollar for jellyfishing items with sentimental value, if you know what I mean.
Patrick: Oh. No.
SpongeBob: Word on the street is that you know where to get quality jellyfishing supplies hmm.
Patrick: What street said that? Was it this one? [points at the street] Mind your own business!
SpongeBob: Oh Mr. Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net. [shows a fake $1,000,000,000 bill that is colored on with crayon] I will pay one billion dollars for that net.
Patrick: I don't know who you are, but you're not getting this jellyfishing net! [holds the jellyfishing case out] I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars, not for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't even sell it for a dollar!
SpongeBob: Oh, really?
Patrick: You can't have it for any price.
SpongeBob: And why not?
Patrick: This means more to me than money. It's my friend SpongeBob's.
SpongeBob: [rips off the mustache. Normal voice] A-ha!
Patrick: SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. There was this scary guy with a mustache asking a lot of weird questions.
SpongeBob: Patrick, [puts on the mustache] I'm the scary mustache guy!
Patrick: [screams] Why, SpongeBob, why?! Why would you wear such a scary mustache?
SpongeBob: [rips off the mustache] Why did you steal my jellyfishing net?!
Patrick: What?!!!? I'm your best friend!
SpongeBob: You were my best friend, you no-good jellyfish net thief!
Patrick: How could you think that?
SpongeBob: Because you said it! You said that it was your friend SpongeBob's!
Patrick: Gift.
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: It's my friend SpongeBob's gift. [opens the case up to reveal a new jellyfishing net] I made you a new net.
SpongeBob: [reads inscription] For SpongeBob. You made me a new jellyfishing net? That is so thoughtful of you! Patrick? [a bunch of stuff is on the ground]
[Patrick puts the TV in the pile.]
SpongeBob: What'cha doing, best friend?
Patrick: I'm not your best friend. I'm just a no-good jelly netting thief fish!
SpongeBob: Where are you going?
Patrick: I'm leaving Bikini Bottom while I still have my dignity.
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! [bus stops in front of them] So, this is it?
Patrick: Barring the unforeseen hand of fate, I'm afraid it is.
SpongeBob: [hands onto Patrick's left foot] Patrick, don't go! I'm sorry I accused you! It's bad enough I lost my net. I don't want to lose my friend, too. Please forgive me.
Nat Peterson: What's the holdup? Oh, it's you two. [shows SpongeBob his net] Look, you left your net on the bus again.
SpongeBob: Ol' Reliable? I left you on the bus?
Nat Peterson: You do it every week. Now can we get going?
SpongeBob: Patrick, I want you to take this to remember me by.
Patrick: You're giving me Ol' Reliable? [cries loudly] I accept your apology!
SpongeBob: Oh, come here, you big lug! [both hug and cry loudly]
All: Aww...
Nat Peterson: They do this all the time. I'm serious. I--ugh, never mind.
Patrick: I'm staying in Bikini Bottom!
Passengers: Hooray! [bus drives off]
Patrick: You want to go jellyfishing? I just got a new net. [holds up Ol' Reliable]
SpongeBob: So did I. [holds up the one Patrick made for him] My best friend made it for me.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Whee! [both laugh and run into Jellyfish Fields, where the exotic jellyfish are still there]
[It is closing time at the Krusty Krab as customers walk out]
Mr. Krabs: Well, good night, folks. Come again. [flips the "Open" sign around to say "Closed"] Thought those deadbeats would never leave. Closin' time, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [washing plates] There ya go, little buddy. Now everybody's all clean and ready for beddy-bye.
Mr. Krabs: [enters kitchen] Time to pack it in, Sponge- Bah! Wha?! [sees a spot on a plate]
SpongeBob: All ready, Mr. Krabs. [he takes his hairnet off] Just gotta clock out and...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's the meaning of this? [SpongeBob inspects the plate and then notices the spot]
SpongeBob: [screams] Spot, spot, spot!
Mr. Krabs: That's right, a spot. You know the rule. Nobody leaves work till...
SpongeBob: ...till everything's ship-shape, sir. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'll get this plate cleaned up in a jiffy.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, and, uh, lock up when you're done.
SpongeBob: Lock up? Wait, Mr. Krabs. Don't you remember what happened last time you left me here alone? [flashback to Krusty Krab on fire]
Mr. Krabs: Should've never left you alone with a lit blow torch and me roller skates. But, since I've removed all the welding equipment from the premises, there's no-ho-ho chance of that happenin' again, right? Now, get to work.
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. [washes the plate but the spot is still on there] You're a tough little guy, aren't ya? [tries to clean it some more, creating steam through friction, but it's not coming off] This means war. [cut to SpongeBob trying to use a jackhammer, but fails and repeatedly get hit in the face with it. He is then seen using a bat and bangs the plate with it, and then a chainsaw to get it off by banging it on the plate, but nothing's working] Wait here, please. [goes off and comes back riding a T-34 Tank, smashing through a safety poster featuring Mr. Krabs] Say good-night, dried on filth. Ready. Aim. Fire! [shoots a pink sponge onto the plate then checks to see if the spot is gone and it's not. He is frustrated] That is the last straw! I want you to remember... [crying] you made me do this. [spits on it and tries to rub it out but nothing happens] Yaahhhh! ["drops plate semi-gently"] I got to finish this. [cut to SpongeBob in an army-like outfit. He speaks worth an accent] I'm afraid this is the last time we'll be meeting like this, my friend. Allow me to introduce you to... the Spot-Master 6000. [a water-gun laser] Notice, the microwave-powered laser particle beam. Notice, the laser-guided high pressure water cannon. And notice, the little surprise I installed just for you. A specially woven metal alloy ingeniously combined with state of the art cleaning materials. [soap, mop, bucket, and other materials are combined with it] I call it... [pushes a button to show a ball of wool] ...steel wool! And it comes with... [a laser pops out of the wool ball] a laser! Any last words? [he puts his ear near the plate] Mmm... I thought not. [he jumps into the seat and puts on goggles] Power up. [we see a Krabby Patty at first and then a green laser the spot] Water cannon... on. [turns it on, a water laser is shooting at the plate.] No effect. Steel wool laser... on! [Turns it on. As the Krusty Krab shakes, lights are shining out of it and Mr. Krabs can see it from his home]
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm... strange vortex in the west. Well, it's probably got nothing to do with SpongeBob. [he walks away, and the scene cuts back to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: OK, you asked for it. It may end life as we know it, but I am crossing the beams! [he crosses the beams] More power! [does so, and it sends out 'sound'-like waves through the air, causing everything to look like it's wiggling. Mr. Krabs checks out his window]
Mr. Krabs: Spontaneous molecular distortion, hmm? I guess I better go see what the lad's up to.
SpongeBob: More power!
Mr. Krabs: [sees a bunch of lasers and fireworks coming from the Krusty Krab] Oh, boy, that can't be good.
SpongeBob: More power!
Mr. Krabs: Let's see what he's done this time. [puts the key in the lock]
SpongeBob: Maximum power! Ahhhhh! [pushes on maximum power. A huge blast wrecks the restaurant and a bursting size of an atomic bomb, which is actually a clip from Operation Crossroad occurs. We now see the restaurant completely destroyed and then the Spot-Master 6000 disintegrates]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, this time you've done it, boy. What've you got to say for yourself?
SpongeBob: [shows Mr. Krabs the clean plate] The platter's all clean, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'll clean your platter! [chases SpongeBob around the ruins of the restaurant] Come here, you! [He chases SpongeBob around the remains of the building]
[Squidward has blonde hair and is playing the clarinet while the crowd is cheering for him]
Tina-Fran: Squidward, we love you!
Audience Member #2: I love you, Squidward. You're my favorite! [Squidward laughs as he does a crowd surf. His alarm goes off and wakes him up]
Squidward: Alright, alright. Time for another hideous day at work. Ahh, just hang in there, gorgeous. [Plays a few notes on his clarinet] Your star will shine at the clarinet recital tomorrow. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Time for another glorious day at work. [winks at his tie, the tie winks back] Good morning, Squidward! [walks down the street with Squidward] And isn't it a lovely morning? Why are you playing the clarinet on your way to work?
Squidward: I'm practicing for my clarinet recital. Soon, all of Bikini Bottom will recognize the talent that is Squidward Tentacles. Goodbye, SpongeBoob.
SpongeBob: See ya at the Krusty Krab, Squidwart. Hey, Sandy, what's this?
Sandy: Well, this here is my new matter transporter. It can move things from one place to another in the blink of an eye.
SpongeBob: Ooh, that sounds fancy.
Sandy: Let me show you how it works. [puts an apple in the transporter]
SpongeBob: Whoa! [apple disappears] Where'd it go?
Sandy: Just where you think it would be. [apple appears on Mrs. Puff's desk]
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
SpongeBob: Uh-oh, I'm late for work. Do you think your machine can zap me over to the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: I always did want to try a critter. Sure, why not? Get in there, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo! [goes into transporter]
Sandy: Hold on tight.
SpongeBob: [transporter starts] Gee, Sandy, this sure feels...
Squidward: [walking up to the Krusty Krab] Well, here we go again. [as he reaches for the door, SpongeBob appears and Squidward's arm is attached through SpongeBob's body]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! [laughs. Sandy's remote is going haywire]
Sandy: What's going on with this thing? [SpongeBob and Squidward get transported back to Sandy's machine] What in tarnation? [gasps. SpongeBob and Squidward are mutated into one body]
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy!
Squidward: I'm not sure what it is, but I something seems different about me.
SpongeBob: Yeah, me too.
Squidward: Hey, what are you doing with my hand? What am I doing with your hand? Ahh! What is this? We're all mixed up together. [tries to detach himself, but fails] This is horrible! I have my clarinet recital tomorrow!
SpongeBob: Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward. Now we can be best buddies and do everything together, forever.
Squidward: [screams] Sandy, was this your doing? You've got to get us separated!
Sandy: Well, I wish I knew how.
Squidward: Well, you have to do something! I can't stay stuck to him!
Sandy: Hmmm, I wonder what would happen if I tried zapping you back in the transporter.
Squidward: Uhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good idea. Let's try it.
Sandy: Well, here goes nothing. [transports to Bikini Bottom Elementary]
Mable: All right, children. Today's Timmy's birthday. You know what that means. Ready, Timmy? [opens present. SpongeBob and Squidward rise up from the box, still mutated together. Mable screams as SpongeBob and Squidward get transported again]
Doctor: Congratulations, Mrs. Smith. You gave birth to a healthy baby boy.
Mrs. Smith: May I see my baby?
Doctor: Of course. [baby appears as SpongeBob & Squidward mutated into one body again. Mrs. Smith screams as they are transported again]
One-Eyed Monster: I've been in love with you ever since I first laid my eye on you. [both monsters kiss. SpongeBob and Squidward appear between them] Hey, baby, what's your name? [SpongeBob and Squidward get transported again. The lady monster slaps the one-eyed monster's face and leaves]
Squidward: It's no use, Sandy. We're still the same.
Sandy: Well, that's a darn shame. You know what, I was working on the blueprints for a new invention. But it's still in the embryonic stage.
Squidward: Try anything! I cannot go to my clarinet recital like this.
Sandy: I'll continue working on it. In the meantime, you boys keep your head up.
SpongeBob: Together forever.
Squidward: Misery. [later, SpongeBob and Squidward are riding a bike to work] SpongeBob, hasn't anyone taught you how to ride a bike?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, I'll drive.
Squidward: [Squidward's head bumps against the wheel of the bike] Ow, ow, ow. SpongeBob! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [both enter the Krusty Krab riding the bike. The bike crashes into the boat and they fly through the kitchen window]
Customer #1: I gotta lay off the hot sauce.
Mr. Krabs: [enters kitchen] What in blazes is going on in here?
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: What are you two doing laying around? Get to work.
Squidward: If you say so. [as they stand up, Mr. Krabs freaks out]
Mr. Krabs: Egad! What happened to ya? Uhh, I don't want to know. Just go do your jobs.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, cap'n!
Squidward: Do you have to be such an accommodating buffoon?
SpongeBob: Squidward, everybody knows I'm a sponge. I look nothing like a balloon.
Squidward: I don't have time for this. I've got to man the cash register. [stretches his head through the kitchen window] Whew. Can I help you?
Customer #2: Can I get two Krabby Patties, please?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I need two Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: Two Krabby Patties coming right up. [notices the buns are out of reach] I can't... reach the buns.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's the holdup?!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on it.
Mr. Krabs: Time is money, boy.
SpongeBob: Time is money. Right. [reaches bun] Hello, bun. At last we meet. [Squidward can't hold the cash register. His head flies through the kitchen window, onto the grill and crashes into SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Alright, that's it. I can't afford you jeopardizing me business. You two are more trouble than you're worth. [pushes them out the restaurant] And don't come back until you get this problem sorted out.
SpongeBob: Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other.
Squidward: That's how we got into this predicament in the first place, you imbecile! Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace. [plays clarinet as they walk past a surfer]
Surfer: Whoa, rock on, freaky bro!
Squidward: Sandy! Sandy! Please tell me you've figured out a way to separate us.
Sandy: Say hello to the 'Molecular Separator Ray'.
Squidward: Hello, Molecular Separator Ray. Well, let's get on with it. My clarinet recital is tomorrow night.
Sandy: Uhh, well, I'm not quite done with it yet.
Squidward: What'd you say?
Sandy: I'm still putting it together. At best I'll have it ready, uhh, the day after tomorrow? Maybe? [Squidward pushes Sandy's air helmet]
Squidward: What?!? Day after tomorrow?! No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No! I have a performance tomorrow! I can't be stuck to that yellow freak! [SpongeBob smiles] Sandy, please, you've got to do it before the show!
Sandy: Well, uhh, I suppose... I'll have it ready before you go on. [Squidward and SpongeBob stretch through their front doors, but can't walk much further, so their houses collide together]
Squidward: Of course. [at the clarinet recital] Oh, my. [not an empty seat in the house] Where are you, Sandy? Sandy? I can't do it. I can't go out there.
SpongeBob: Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar!
Squidward: Superstar?
SpongeBob: Now go out there and give them the best darn show they've ever seen!
Squidward: You're right! The show must go on!
Announcer: Ladies and gentlefish, Bikini Bottom's Community Rec Center is proud to present: Squidward Tentacles. [curtain rises to Squidward wearing a big cape like clothing. Squidward starts playing and everyone begins to hate it]
Evelyn: Honey, I'm scared. [the crowd continues to dislike Squidward playing the clarinet, the cape comes off as a nail tears it. SpongeBob starts to see the crowd, the crowd gasps]
SpongeBob: Uhh, hi.
Martin: Whoa. Rock on, freaky bro! Yeah. Whoo! [crowd cheers]
SpongeBob: Wow, they really liked it.
Mr. Krabs: [laughing] There you go, Squiddy!
Squidward: They... they... they're cheering. Superstardom. This must be what it feels like. This is what it looks like. What it [starts to laugh happily] sounds like. And... [smells the air] ...what it smells like. Oh, simply intoxicating.
Sandy: Whoo-wee, there you boys are. Looks like I'm just in time.
SpongeBob and Squidward: Sandy?
Sandy: One blast of this Molecular Separator Ray and you'll be separated for good. [SpongeBob and Squidward try to tell Sandy not to blast them, but was too late, she blasts the ray at Squidward and SpongeBob and it separates them. Crowd gasps]
Squidward: [SpongeBob gives him back his clarinet] Hmph. [plays clarinet off-key making SpongeBob cheer for him, but the audience hates it as they block their ears, Old Man Jenkins faints off his chair]
Mary: I think I'm going to be sick! [Squidward blows his clarinet at Billy, which blows his skin off and shows his skeleton]
Billy: Ah, I'm out of here!
Squidward: Huh, no, wait. Wait! [everyone leaves] Oh, my one moment of fame... gone. [grabs the separator ray] There's got to be some way to reverse this. [pushes the button over and over]
Sandy: No, Squidward! That's a very sensitive device!
SpongeBob: Squidward, I wouldn't--! [laser blasts into the final scene]
Therapist: So, what seems to be the problem, Mr. Tentacles?
Squidward: It all started when I was born. [camera zooms out to show Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, Pearl, Larry, SpongeBob, and Squidward joined together]
[A bus is driving down the road with three band members sitting inside.]
Band Member #1: Man, this is gonna be our most rocking tour, ever.
Band Member #2: [singing] Yeah.
Ned: Hey, dudes, check out the debut of my new look. [band members laugh]
Band Member #1: Whoa, what's that on your head?
Band Member #3: Yeah, is that a wig or a pile of toilet paper?
Ned: C'mon, guys, give it a chance.
Band Member #2: Let me try it on. [grabs the wig]
Ned: Hey, you've revealed my shiny dome!
Band Member #2: Hot potato. Catch! [band members throw it back and forth between each other]
Ned: Give it back, man!
Band Member #2: If you want it, you gotta catch it, dude. [throws it to band member, but it goes through the window]
Band Member #1: Oops.
Ned: Ah! Oh, man, my beautiful wig! [the wig flies through the air, in and out of the dump then through the wig cemetery]
SpongeBob: [opens his front door] I'm ready! I'm rea... [the wig crashes into him and he falls over. He sits up and it's on top of his head] Ah, what is this? Curly tresses, poofy texture, [scratches inside wig] itchy scalp... [gasps] it's a wig! [walks over to Patrick's rock] Hi, Patrick. How do you like my new wig?
Patrick: [screams, then jumps on SpongeBob, pinning him to the ground] I'll save you. [jumps on SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Pa... trick... what are... you doing?
Patrick: I'm saving you from that brain-eating alien that's attacking your... [slams SpongeBob's head on to a rock] ...head!
SpongeBob: Patrick, the only thing attacking me is you!
Patrick: [stops] Oh, sorry.
SpongeBob: It's okay. [Patrick takes a bite out of the wig] Why did you do that?
Patrick: [swallows and burps] Well, I thought it was a new type of cotton candy you wear on your head.
SpongeBob: Well, it's not, but that is an excellent idea.
Patrick: Then what is it?
SpongeBob: It's my new look. I'm wearing a wig.
Patrick: A wig? [laughs uncontrollably] Oh, boy. Don't you think that's a little silly? [in his pocket, an alarm starts to ring so he takes it out] Oh, man, it's time for my weekly condiment soak. [climbs into a tub and pours a giant jar of mustard on himself. Looks at SpongeBob] Do you mind? [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking down the street with his wig on]
Fish #1: Nice wig. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: Thanks. I am very fashionable today.
Tina: Hey, SquareFashion, nice couture.
SpongeBob: Why, thank you.
Pilar: So then... [notices SpongeBob] Huh...?
Peterson: Nice do, SpongeBob. [tries to contain his laughter]
Pilar: Yeah, where can I get one? [Peterson and Pilar laugh]
Sally: Whoa. That wig really suits you. [laughing]
SpongeBob: [walks up to Squidward, who is sleeping on the job] Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: [screams] Who? What? Where? What? How?
SpongeBob: Notice anything different about me today, Squidward? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh? ...Huh?
Squidward: Nope.
SpongeBob: I'm wearing a wig.
Squidward: Oh yeah, how could I have missed it?
SpongeBob: Can you believe I found it lying around in the street?
Squidward: Umm...maybe.
SpongeBob: If you want to, after work, we can go look for a wig for you.
Squidward: I can't wait.
SpongeBob: Wig away! [floats into the kitchen. While grilling some patties, he scratches his wig with the spatula and many hairs float down onto the patties. He puts one of the hairy patties on the bun] Order up, Squidward. [Squidward notices the hair on the Krabby Patty]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs walks up to Squidward] I've served a lot of junk here, but a hair patty?
Mr. Krabs: [walks into the kitchen] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs? [a lot of hairs come off the wig and onto Mr. Krabs eyes]
Mr. Krabs: What in Davy Jones' locker is on your head, son?
SpongeBob: Oh, that's my new wig, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, take it off. The hair's getting into the patties.
SpongeBob: Take it off? But I can't, Mr. Krabs. My wig makes everyone so happy.
Mr. Krabs: Happy?
SpongeBob: Ever since I've been wearing it, everyone I see gets a big grin on their face.
Mr. Krabs: I can imagine.
SpongeBob: Oh, please let me keep it, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, if it means that much to ya, you can keep it. But you gotta wear a hairnet. [takes one out] And if I see one more hairy patty, your wig goes in the dumpster.
SpongeBob: [puts the hairnet over his wig then walks out with an order]
Sandy: There you are, SpongeBob. Are you ready for karate prac...tice? [notices SpongeBob's wig]
SpongeBob: I see you've noticed my new wig. Pretty impressive, huh?
Sandy: Wig's... uh great...SpongeBob. [laughs uncontrollably]
SpongeBob: Glad you like it. [chuckles] I'll see you later, Sandy. [walks up to a table and sets the tray on it] Two krabby patties and a side order of looking good.
Frank: Nice wig.
Abigail: Like to keep in style, huh?
SpongeBob: You know it.
Francis: Off to meet the queen, Sir Nerdlaroy?
SpongeBob: Uh, the name's SpongeBob and no, I am not meeting royalty. You must be referring to my regal appearance. [gets off balance with the wig and stumbles into the corner. Everyone crowds around him and laughs] Thank you all for your kind words. I wish I could give you such nice wigs.
Jimmy: How 'bout a little off the top?
Tom: Yeah, your wig is big enough to go around.
SpongeBob: This isn't good. Everyone's getting jealous. [walks backwards towards the kitchen] Squidward, I'll be hiding in the kitchen if you need me.
Squidward: Hide your shame, SpongeBob. Hide your shame. [scene cuts to Bigshot Records]
Record Producer: Well, well, well, Ned and the Needlefish. You're fired.
Band: Fired?!
Band Member #2: But why?
Record Producer: Ask Baldy McBalderson over here.
Band: Ned!
Band Member #2: Good going, dude.
Ned: I can't help not having hair!
Band Member #3: When we formed this band, it was for one reason and one reason only: to make a lot of money. And you not having hair is getting in the way of that!
Record Producer: We are selling records, not denture cream! [talking to Ned] Either you come back with hair, or don't come back at all! [scene cuts to Krusty Krab at closing time]
Mr. Krabs: [flips OPEN sign to CLOSED] Time to go home, boys.
SpongeBob: [mopping with his wig] Almost finished. [puts the wet wig on his head. Shakes it dry and it goes back to its original shape] See, Squidward, it's functional, too.
Squidward: It's about as functional as your brain.
SpongeBob: [giggles] Thank you, Squidward.
Squidward: That wasn't a compliment! The entire town is laughing at you!
SpongeBob: I don't understand.
Squidward: [holds a mirror up to SpongeBob] Just look at yourself.
SpongeBob: Hello, handsome. [licks finger and puts it on the mirror] Sss.
Squidward: SpongeBob, your head is twice as large as before.
SpongeBob: Hmmm, I've never been tall before.
Squidward: That wig is infested with parasites. [spiders crawl out of the wig and SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: That tickles.
Squidward: Can't you see how ridiculous you look?
SpongeBob: I think that it looks cool.
Mr. Krabs: Hahahaha. You wouldn't know cool if I locked you in the freezer. [laughs]
SpongeBob: For your information, Mr. Krabs, Squidward has locked me in the freezer, so I think I know what cool is.
Mr. Krabs: Well, stop wearing that nasty thing to work.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: No buts.
SpongeBob: So I can't have a wig or a butt?
Mr. Krabs: No, SpongeBob, it means until you get rid of that wig. Get your butt out of here! [scene cuts to Sandy walking up to SpongeBob's house]
Sandy: I never got a chance to talk to SpongeBob yesterday. I was laughing too hard. [knocks on door] SpongeBob? Huh?
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy. What do you think?
Sandy: We need to talk. [scene cuts to The Reef]
SpongeBob: Why would I want to get rid of my wig? Look at how happy it makes everybody. [everyone is laughing]
Sandy: Well, it does attract a lot of attention.
SpongeBob: I know. People just can't keep their eyes off of me.
Sandy: Neither can I, SpongeBob. [they walk in to the theater. Scooter closes the door and laughs. Scene cuts to inside theater, where the movie is playing]
Martha: It's true, John, this isn't my real hair! I stole it! [takes her wig off. SpongeBob walks into the row with his wig blocking the screen]
SpongeBob: Oops. Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. [Peterson sticks out his leg [along with an angry Nazz] and SpongeBob trips over it. SpongeBob gets his wig stuck in some cheese on the floor. Get sunstuck but a soda is still in the wig] Hey, the wig broke my fall! [some popcorn falls from the top of his wig] Mmm, popcorn. [eats some then takes the soda in his wig and takes a sip of it] Ah, you always come through for me.
Dale: [With a voice similar to Mr. Krabs's] Hey buddy, do you mind?
SpongeBob: Shhh! It's very rude to talk during a movie! [Dale behind SpongeBob starts to growl, the camera pans to the right to get a picture of Sandy. subitles version Shh... It's very rude to talk during a movie. [growling]
Sandy: Umm, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [Interrupting Sandy] You, too, Sandy. People are trying to watch the movie.
Sandy: Well, they can't. Look, your stupid wig is blocking the whole screen. [all talking at once. We can hear some of them. Fish #1 says: "Take it off, jerk!". Fish #2 says: "Hey!". Fish #3 says: "Hey! Down in front!". Fish #4 says: "Take the wig off!".
All: [everyone are talking at once. We can hear some of them] Fish #1: Take it off, Jerk!; Fish #2: Hey!; Fish #3: Hey! Down in front!; Fish #4: Take the wig off!
SpongeBob: People, return your attention to the movie. I know my wig is glamorous and exciting but there is no need to start a riot.
Scooter: That's a great idea! Let's start a riot. [everyone gets a pitchfork or torch ready]
SpongeBob: [screams as he and Sandy run out as the riot follows.]
Frank: [talking to Peterson] I told you that movie was terrible.
[Cut to a grassland, SpongeBob and Sandy are seen walking and talking]
Sandy: Now do you see what I'm saying, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I guess you're right, Sandy. I got so much enjoyment out of the wig, myself, I assumed everyone else did, too.
Sandy: It's time to be strong.
SpongeBob: I know. [walks over to the edge of the cliff and takes his wig off] I just want you to know that even though I didn't know you existed a few days ago, I can't imagine life without you!
Sandy: Hurry up, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: No matter what they say, you'll always be cool to me. [wig flies off, SpongeBob starts crying] I'll never accessorize again.
Sandy: You did the right thing, SpongeBob. [scene cuts to Ned walking down the street]
Ned: Where am I gonna get some hair? My career is ruined. Ruined! [sobbing] Can it be? It is! My wig. Yes! Victory is mine.
SpongeBob: Wigs. Wigs, wigs, they're everywhere.
Debbie: Oh, he's got your hair.
Shubie: Thank you.
Patrick: [without a wig on his head] SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick! At least he's not wearing a wig.
Patrick: Look at my new wig. [raises his arm and the wig is attached to his armpit]
SpongeBob: Everyone's wearing wigs! Everyone! I'm starting to feel a little betrayed. Hey, you made fun of me yesterday. I thought powdered wigs were uncool.
Fish #1: Yeah, they were. But look... [points to a billboard with Ned and the Needlefish wearing the same wigs]
SpongeBob: Wow. Ned and the Needlefish wearing my wig. So, I was cool before anyone else?
Fish #1: Yes, you were. But not anymore. See ya! [walks off]
SpongeBob: I wish I had a wig. [Patrick walks up to him]
Patrick: Don't be sad, SpongeBob. You can borrow one of mine. [rips his wig off his armpit and pits it on SpongeBob's head] Just wash it before you return it.
Mr. Krabs: Here they come, lads!
SpongeBob: Hooray!
Squidward: Fantastic. [crowd comes rushing in running over Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: Thank you very much, madam. [Mr. Krabs pushes the key to open the cash register over and over] I feel so alive! Cha ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaree. Money, oh money, how I love thee. Cha-ching. Cha-chong. Cha-changaroo. From pennies to dollars. Any amount will do. Cha-ching. Cha-ching. It's no contest. There's only one thing that I love the best from every sight I ever seen, to sweetest sound I've heard. I'd gladly give up everything for all the money that I've earned! Cha-ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaring. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed!♪
Squidward: Please don't do that again.
Howard: [walks in the Krusty Krab] I think the stain glass barstool can go over here. And the suede hand carved wooden sports flag display case can go over there.
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy there, matey. Can I help you gentlemen with something?
Howard: I'd like to speak to the owner.
Mr. Krabs: Who wants to know?
Howard: Allow me to introduce myself. Howard Blandy: President of the Blandy Franchising Company.
Mr. Krabs: Howard Blandy? You mean the Howard Blandy? The Howard Blandy that masterminded the ruthless takeover of every small family owned business in Bikini Bottom? That Howard Blandy? [gets on his knees] I worship you. [cries]
Howard: Get it together, little man.
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, it's just you're rich. [laughs] I'm Mr. Krabs. To what do I owe the honor of having you at the Krusty Krab, Howard?
Howard: [slaps Mr. Krabs’ claw] What would it take to buy the Krusty Krab from you?
Mr. Krabs: Buy the Krusty Krab? It's not for sale. You know, I may not make as much as your fancy-schmancy-migger restaurant chain, but it's the blood, sweat, and tears of a hard days work. It's not about the mon... [suitcase full of money is shown to Mr. Krabs] Holy sweet mother of pearl! I like the way you think, Blandy. But it's gonna take a lot more than a suitcase of cash to buy the Krusty Krab from me.
Howard: Oh, there's a lot more than that. The rest is over there. [points to a boat full of suitcases with money]
Mr. Krabs: Jumpin' King Neptune! [gulps] Sold. Can I have my money?
Howard: Just one thing. If you can sign this contract. It just states that you relinquish the Krusty Krab and all proprietary ownership thereof. Along with its employees, merchandise, logos, and cash registers.
Mr. Krabs: Do I still get the money?
Howard: Of course.
Mr. Krabs: That'll be fine then. [signs contract] Here you go. Now gimme gimme gimme gimme. [holds suitcase up in the air] Whoo-ha! See ya around. [walks out of the Krusty Krab. Contractors & painters come in remodeling]
SpongeBob: What's happening? Mr Krabs! Mr Krabs, they're putting up pennants in the Krusty Krab. What's going on?
Mr. Krabs: I'm retiring!
SpongeBob: Retiring?
Mr. Krabs: I'm free to do whatever I want. I can learn to ride that bicycle I got 30 years ago. Or go to the new hook museum downtown. Or even paint bowls of fruit. Aren't you happy for me?
SpongeBob: I sure am.
Mr. Krabs: So long, boys.
SpongeBob: Have fun, Mr. Krabs. [cries]
Squidward: Heaven knows I won't.
Carl: Hi, gentlemen, I'm Carl. I'll be your new manager.
SpongeBob: New manager?
Carl: I think you'll find working at the Krabby O'Monday’s to be a both learning experience and enjoyable one.
SpongeBob: Krabby O'Monday’s?
Carl: [takes away their Krusty Krew hats] You won't be needing these anymore. [hands them new clothes] Now here are your new uniforms and here are the... [hands them heavy books] employee manuals. See ya first thing tomorrow.
Mr. Krabs: [driving boat and smelling the air] Ahh, the sweet smell of a brand-new day. First stop: the new hook museum. And then maybe I'll... [sees the Krabby O'Monday’s] Hey, the Krabby O'Monday’s? Not the name I would've chosen, but that's all behind me now. [later, Mr. Krabs is at the Hook Museum listening to the story narrator about a 3 prong hook. Then he is at his home painting a bowl of fruit, which he actually paints a bowl of Krabby Patties. Then he is playing golf] Wait a minute. I hate golf! [now laying in his bed at home, sucking drool back into his mouth] Well, I've done everything I wanted to do. And it's not even noon.
Pearl: [on phone] Did you see the shoes she has on? So last year. [laughs. Notices her father in the doorway] Hold on, Gina. Yeah, Dad?
Mr. Krabs: How's it going?
Pearl: Fine.
Mr. Krabs: Whatcha up to?
Pearl: I'm talking on the phone!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, really?
Pearl: Really.
Mr. Krabs: Oh.
Pearl: Dad, isn't there something you need to do?
Mr. Krabs: Actually, I was hoping you and I could do something together.
Pearl: [pushes him out] Get out! That's it, Dad. Get a job, get a hobby, or get some friends. Because I can't take it anymore! [slams the door offscreen]
Mr. Krabs: [using metal detector on the beach] Get some friends she says, find a hobby she says, get a job she says... [runs into a window with a 'Help Wanted' sign] Help wanted. [walks into the Krabby O'Monday’s]
Squidward: Ahoy there, mateys. Welcome to Krabby O'Monday’s.
Tyler: It's my birthday.
Squidward: Can I start you off with...
Mother: Will you sing the Krabby O'Monday’s birthday song to my special little man?
Squidward: Happy, happy birthday. [sighs, as the family frowns in disgust] Happy, happy bir...
Carl: Uhh, Squidward, can I talk to you for a second? What's our motto here at Krabby O'Monday’s?
Squidward: Sincere service with a smile?
Carl: Well, yes, but with the Krabby O'Monday’s spirit. Now, Squidward, you wouldn't want to have to talk to human resources... [A big strong guy slowly steps out of the Human Resources doorway, punching his fist in his open hand, menacingly] ...would you? So, what's our motto again?
Squidward: Sincere service [slaps self; forcefully smiling] with a smile. [he draws his eyes back to the big strong guy who slowly goes back into the room]
Carl: Now you're gettin' it.
Mr. Krabs: [in kitchen cleaning dishes] Morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! What are you doing here?
Mr. Krabs: Retirement ain't all it's cracked up to be. So, I'm the new bus boy. [whistles as he sees SpongeBob with a big smile] Uhh, okay, son. You're starting to creep my out.
SpongeBob: [clings to Mr. Krabs] I knew you'd come back, Mr. Krabs, I just knew you would.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boy, back to work.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, sir.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not your boss anymore. Just call me Eugene.
SpongeBob: Aye aye... Eugene. [giggles, while Mr. Krabs makes a weird look]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, Squidward.
Squidward: Ahoy, Eugene! Would you mind clearing this table for me?
Mr. Krabs: Sure, Squidward. Ya know, I've never seen you so happy.
Squidward: [looks at Carl with his teeth grinned] They're watching us.
Mr. Krabs: That guy's a real pain in the hindquarters, eh Squiddy? [laughs, as Carl looks suspicious]
Squidward: Uhh, Eugene, I think you need to look at page 20 of our employee handbook again.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I don't need Carl's silly rules.
Squidward: I really think you should look. [pointing to a message]
Mr. Krabs: What's this? Help me?
Carl: Hey fellas, [Squidward quickly slams the book closed] what's going on over here?
Squidward: Oh, hey, Carl, uhh, I was just reminding Eugene of article 24 section 3 of our employee handbook.
Carl: Cut the chatter, and pick up a platter. [slaps him] Good job, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: What have you done to the real Squidward?
Carl: The less you know, Eugene, the better. [closes the door]
Mr. Krabs: What's going on around here? Where's SpongeBob? [in the kitchen, Krabby Patties are being made in a different way through an oven and spray painted to make it look like a real Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: [takes a Krabby Patty from the basket] Where's the love?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what happened to the Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob: I tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen to me!
Mr. Krabs: This is obscene. [walks out of the kitchen] Carl, I need to have a word with...
Cash Register: Your change is $1.75.
Mr. Krabs: Automated cash register? Noo! [eyes roll back in his head] Hey, Carl, what have you done to me restaurant? Processed Krabby Patties? Computerized registers?
Carl: Look around you. Our customers are quite content with the contrived and the mediocre. [customer falls asleep, snoring]
Mr. Krabs: That's because they don't know what they're eating. [grabs a pile of the gray sludge from the Krabby Patty making machine in the kitchen, then walks up to a customer] Excuse me, ma'am, do you know what's in that Krabby Patty you're eating?
Martha Smith: No. [Mr. Krabs shows her a pile of the gray sludge. The customer screams and runs out]
Mr. Krabs: See that? Without all your smoke & mirrors, no one would stomach this garbage.
Frank: What'd he say? Garbage? [customers notice what's in the Krabby Patties and everyone runs out]
Carl: Eugene, you're in violation of your contract.
Mr. Krabs: Rules! Here's a rule for ya: people can't eat stain glass barstools! [throws barstool into the big screen TV and takes the cash register to the kitchen] I'll show you automated!
Carl: Mr. Blandy? Code red! Free thinker!
[Mr. Krabs shoves the cash register in the Krabby Patty making machine]
Howard: Mr. Krabs, is there a problem here?
Mr. Krabs: You better believe there's a problem! I used to kiss the ground you walked on, Blandy! But after seeing this, I wouldn't even spit in your direction! Krabby Patties are supposed to be made by hand, one at a time! Not on a conveyor belt! [Krabby Patty machine inflates and about to blow up.]
Carl: Oh, my. [The garbage blows up from the kitchen and blows everybody away off the Krabby O'Monday’s including the employees. The restaurant blows up and got destroyed. Carl was seen floating away.] Does this mean I won't get that raise, sir?
Howard: [he looks at the restaurant which is destroyed by the gray meat] It's ruined!
Friend: We'll have to sell it. We'll be lucky if we get a fraction of what we paid for it. [Mr. Krabs drives up with boat full of suitcases]
Mr. Krabs: I'll buy it for full price.
Friend: Sold. We won't need your contract anymore. [rips off the contract] Nice doing business with you.
Mr. Krabs: Pleasure's all mine. Now get out of me restaurant. [laughs while Howard and his friends walks away, leaving SpongeBob and Squidward.] Well, we did it, boys. [puts the hats on them] The Krusty Krab is ours again. Ya know, in a fit of maniacal rage, I may have destroyed the restaurant, scared away all our customers, and forced us into bankruptcy because I returned nearly every penny I sold this stink heap for, but it was all worth it. And I got back the love of my dear friends.
Squidward: Really, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: No, not really. Get back to work! [He hands them Spatula and the Mop. SpongeBob was glad while Squidward was annoyed leaving Mr. Krabs, who now pushes the key to open the register and ends with dollar signs.]
SpongeBob: Bikini Bottom pet show today! Good thing I put those notes there. Otherwise, I could've forgotten. And I wouldn't wanna do that because the Bikini Bottom pet show is where you gotta go to see the best pets in town. Not that any other pet can take a chance against my buddy Gary. He's the bestest pet in the whole world. Love you, Gare-Gare. [Watch rings] Oh! The show starts in an hour! Hey, Gare, time to... Gary? Ow! Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary?
Perch Perkins: Looks like another beautiful day here in Bikini Bottom. It... Huh?
SpongeBob: [walks onto set where the Perch is doing his newscast from] Gary? [gasps from coming out of Squidward's bathtub] Gary? Oh, hi ya, Squidward. [Squidward kicks him out of his house through the window and SpongeBob screams] Whoooooooaaaaaa! Ohhhhhhhh! Gary? Gary? Gary? [SpongeBob walks back and finds Gary hiding in the bookshelf] Gary, there you are. [pulls Gary off] What are you doing here? Well, today is the day you show everyone else you're the best pet in the whole world. Now, for a quick checklist. Let's see, eye reflects. Check. Slime viscosity. [SpongeBob drags Gary's slime around his house, then, Squidward's house] Hi, Squidward. [Continues] Ready! Hi again, Squidward.
Squidward: Yello.
SpongeBob: Check. And last, but not least, a quick undercarriage check. [Gary hisses] Whoa, okay, maybe we should skip that one. Let's see... Yep, that's about does it. A second, buddy. I'll carry your shell. [Dogs bark]
Fish #1: Stand up straight. Posture is everything in appearance.
Fish #2: Roll over.
Fish #3: Your newly trimmed hairstyles highlight your regality.
SpongeBob: Huh, people sure seem to treat their pets differently here.
Charles: That's a good boy, Foofie. Look at your luxurious mane. Every self-respecting snail has one.
SpongeBob: Luxurious mane?
Foofie: Meow.
Charles: Oh, yes. How could I forget? Accessories! Your diamond-studded leash?
SpongeBob: I always use an old rope. I guess that's not good enough.
Charles: Of course, there's the cherry on the beauty cake: the glossy painted shell! And last, but not least, well maintained oral hygiene. Just look at your pearly whites!
SpongeBob: Uh, Gary?
Gary: Meeeoooowwwwwwwww. [Gary opens his mouth and shows his rotten teeth]
Charles: Anyway, we best run along, Foofs. Your pedicure is in half an hour.
SpongeBob: Pedicure? I didn't realize how much went into this.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, don't be so protective of me, Gary. I know I've been an horrible parent. But no longer! From this moment on forth, I vow to give my Gary the utmost in empty frivolity! To live by the standards of snail grooming, set forth by: that guy!
Patrick: What's up?
SpongeBob: No, not you.
Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBob: Enough dilly-dallying! We got to get down to business!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Hold still, Gary. Uhhhhhh! Come on, buddy! [Gary hisses and meows] Uhh! Uhh! There. Oh, you're like a little cuddly present. [laughs]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: And the piece de resistance: glow-in-the-dark paint. Hey, where are you going? Gary, wait. We got to go back to the pet show!
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Because we have got to show those other pets we are just as fancy as they are. [Gary's tongue spits] Oh, come on, Gary. Don't be this way. I'm doing it for you, not me.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: That's what I like to hear because I can bring this out. Your very own studded collar. With two rows of diamonds. Here, try it on. Now, let's get back out there and knock them out of their shells.
Gary: Meow.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm so glad you just happened to show up. Help me. [Whispers. Gary tries to get away, but they both grab him and put him into a bathtub. Patrick opens Gary's mouth so SpongeBob can brush his teeth] Gary, stop it! I'm only doing this because I love you. [cut to later where SpongeBob and Patrick are walking Gary down the street] Gary, look, it's him.
Charles: Come, now, Foof. Put your tail up, up, up.
SpongeBob: Hello! Sorry to bother you. Just wanted to get your opinion on my snail, Gary.
Charles: [laughs] My boy, don't seem to get it, do you? There's only one way to prove your pet's beauty. By winning the pet contest. But I wouldn't bother, seeing as how Foofie and I have won in the past five years! [laughs] Oh, well, enough mingling with the common folk. Let's go win our medal, Foof. [Opens his umbrella as he and Foofie fly over to the pet show]
SpongeBob: This is it, Gary. This is our time to shine! [He, Gary and Patrick go into the pet show] Wow, Patrick. There's a whole lot of pet loving going on here today.
Patrick: Yeah. You and Gary don't have a chance.
Store owner: Excuse me, sir, but all non-pet owners must remain behind this rope.
Patrick: Now, what am I gonna do? I'm all alone behind this rope!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm right here.
Patrick: You don't understand, SpongeBob! You'll never understand what it's like to be alone behind the red rope! [starts crying and runs away]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Gary. He'll be back in time to see us win first place. Now, let's go scope out the competition.
Fish #5: There it is, Mrs. Squiggles. Your new hairdo.
Fish #6: There you go, Muffsies. Oh, isn't that cute.
Muffsies: Meeeeoooowww!
Fish #6: [gasps] Poor Muffsies, your shades slipped right off your little eyes? Lucky I brought an extra smaller pair. Uhhhhhhhh! [Puts it on Muffsies' eyes]
Muffsies: [Growling]
SpongeBob: Hmm... Maybe you needs some shades, eh, Gare? [Sees Gary eating his leash] Silly boy, you're not supposed to eat the leash.
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: Come on, buddy.
Fish #7: Now, let's try this cape.
Kenney: [sighs]
SpongeBob: Boy, these pets are gussied today. Maybe I need a top hat or something to class it up a bit. Gary? Oh, thanks for reminding me. I didn't know your collar was loose. [Gary coughs] Now, let's go get that top hat, buddy. Uhhhhhhhhhh! There you go.
Gary: Meow.
Judge: All right, let's see. [examines each snail] Uh-huh. Decent Stalk Length. Oh, good hinge action. Ah, Foofie. Excellent bow stretch. Well-defined eyelid capillaries. Foofie is looking as good as ever, Charles.
Charles: Oh, why, thank you, sir.
Judge: [moves onto Gary] Okay, let's have a look-see, shall we? Ah, yes, good spacing on the larynx. Nice gastric chamber. All within breed description.
SpongeBob: It's in the bag!
Judge: Now, if we can just check the undercarriage. [Gary screeches and bites the judge]
Gary: Meoooooowwwwwww! [everyone gasps]
SpongeBob: Gary, no! Gary, you spit him out right now! [takes Gary off of the judge’s head as he slithers goes over to the podium. To the judge] I'm sorry. He usually only bites me.
[Gary goes over to the podium.]
Gary: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!
Pets: Meow, meow, meow, meow.
Gary: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, MEOWWWW!!!!
Pets: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!
Gary: Meow, meow! Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh! Meooooooooooowwwwwwwwwww!
Pets: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!
Fish #8: Muffsies, you're angry.
Pets: Meow, meow, meow, meow!
Fish #9: What's going on?
Pets: Meesssssss! Meow! Meow! Meow!
Charles: What a hideous display. At least I know you would never behave like all these heathens, right, Foofie?
[Foofie snarls, takes off the collar and monocle, and attacks Charles.]
Charles: Foofie? Foofie!
Pets: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!
Gary: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow! [Flames burn as the sign Bikini Bottom Pet Show turns into Pet Riot]
Mrs. Squiggles: Grrrrohhhhhhhhhhhh! Meow!
Drake: Ohhhgrrrrrrr...
Fish #6: No Muffsies, no!... Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Fish #10: No, wait! Wait! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Victoria: Ohhhhhhhhhhh!
Fish #11: Ahhhhhhhhhhohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Max: Uhh!
Fish #12: Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
Pets: Grrrrrrohhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ruff, ruff!
Charles: Foofie, what have you done?
Foofie: Grrrrrrrrrrrr...
Charles: What's this about? Does anyone speak snail?
SpongeBob: I speak a little bit, sir. I know what they're saying. They're saying: Owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners. Please, please, please, please please, please, please don't be this way. They're saying they don't want this type of pampering. They want to be treated as companions, not dress-up dolls. They don't want scratchy outfits, they want to be scratched! They are protesting the indignity of wigs and jewel-encrusted collars and they want to be free from superficial and degrading pageants, like these.
Pets: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
SpongeBob: You were trying to tell me that all along, weren't you, Gary?
Gary: Meow, meow!
SpongeBob: Well, I won't let it happen again.
Judge: Well, I think we can all agree that this year’s groomers cup goes to... SpongeBob and his wonderful pet!
SpongeBob: Did you hear that, Gary? They're rewarding you for standing up and speaking out against injustice. Maybe these pageants aren't so superficial after all.
Judge: What are you talking about? The snail didn't win, I was referring to your other pet. He's so adorable.
Patrick: [on a leash] Woof, woof! [Sticks his tongue out and wags his ‘tail’]
Narrator: Ah. Another quiet day in Bikini Bottom. But it wasn't always this way. Once, it was horrible. [lightning strikes. Arecacease trees are blowing in the wind. A bridge wobbles. People try to get a pig across in a flood. Cut to SpongeBob's house in rain] The unimaginable happened. One day, SpongeBob SquarePants... changed his pants! [a woman screams] I remember it as if it were yesterday. But, in fact, in happened three days ago. [calendar rewinds to three days ago. SpongeBob carries a load of his pants and puts them in the washing machine. Then walks up to Gary]
SpongeBob: It's laundry day, Gary! [takes off Gary's shell, revealing his butt] Oops. [puts Gary's shell back on then takes it off again, revealing underwear]
Gary: [crawls off] Meow.
SpongeBob: [puts the shell in the washer, closes the lid, and turns it o]) Now to finish the day's chores. [vacuums, washes dishes, and dusts the TV. The phone rings] Hello?
Patrick: Hello. Uh, may I speak with SpongeBob, uh, uh... [looks at his hand and reads what's on it] ...Squaaa...re...Paaaaants?
SpongeBob: Mm, speaking.
Patrick: Hey, hey. You want to hear how long I can do this for? [monotone spluttering]
SpongeBob: Actually, Patrick, I'm kind of busy. Can it wait?
Patrick: [still going] No. [continues. SpongeBob sighs]
Narrator: Much later... [We hear Patrick making all the sound effects over phone and SpongeBob being bored. Gary slithers away]
SpongeBob: Gary, go check on the laundry in the dryer.
Gary: Meow, meow. [puts his shell back on and starts the dryer, which has all the square pants in it. Gary goes through the pet door]
Narrator: Much much later... [SpongeBob's just sitting there on his chair and Patrick is done making all the sound effects]
Patrick: A pretty long time. Huh?
SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick. [goes into the laundry room] Gary? [opens the dryer and gasps. All his pants are tiny] They've shrunk! [puts a pair of pants on each leg] I'm gonna need to get new pants. [cut to Mall]
Clerk: I'm sorry, Mr. SpongeBob, but we're not expecting another shipment of square pants for months.
SpongeBob: Oh. [tries on some different pairs of pants] No. Nope. Ew, not these. Uh-uh. [notices a round pair of pants. Tries them on and they are a tight fit] Whoa, these pants hug my body better than my own mother! [goes out for a walk and walks past Patrick] Hey, Patrick! Notice anything different? Pose. Pose. Pose. Pose.
Patrick: Do I know you?
SpongeBob: [laughs] It's me, SpongeBob.
Patrick: SpongeBob? [looks at the drawing on his hand that says ' SquarePants'] No, you're not! SpongeBob has square pants. Now, leave me alone, you mysterious stranger.
SpongeBob: Patrick is so full of tartar sauce. I'm still me. It's just a pair of pants. It's not like my friends won't recognize me.
Sandy: Well, howdy, stranger! I don't recognize you in those newfangled dungarees. [wolf whistles] You must be SpongeBob FancyPants. Clothes really do make the man!
SpongeBob: Sandy didn't recognize me either. These pants are more powerful than I thought. Course it was just Sandy, and Neptune knows what goes on inside a squirrel's head. [a real squirrel is shown looking left to right] But I know my best buddy Squidward will recognize me. We have been through so much together. [cut to SpongeBob walking up to Squidward's house, humming a tune]
Squidward: Oh, no. It's that little yellow freak.
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: Just ignore him. Maybe he'll go away.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward! Guess who?
Squidward: Do I know you?
SpongeBob: Oh, sure you do. It's me, SpongeBob... SquarePants.
Squidward: Never seen you before in my life.
SpongeBob: Well, maybe these pictures of us together will job your memory. [picture of Squidward running away from SpongeBob is shown] Me and you at my birthday party. [picture of Squidward sleeping at work] You and me at work. [picture of Squidward sleeping in his bed] That little slumber party we had last week. [picture of Squidward showering with the curtain closed] I forgot when this was taken.
Squidward: Is that supposed to be you? [SpongeBob sighs and walks away] I can't believe it. He actually left. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Squidward didn't know me either. It's like we'd never met. Maybe Patrick is right. [can't get in his door] Oh no, it's locked. [knocks on door] Gary! Hey, Gary! Can you open the door?! I left my keys in the other pants. [Patrick opens the door]
Patrick: Hello. Can I help you?
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob.
Patrick: Oh, right. You're that round pants fellow.
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing in my house?
Patrick: Your house? This house belongs to SpongeBob SquarePants. At least it did before he left us. [blows nose] I wish I could see him one last time. [closes the door]
SpongeBob: Oh, barnacles! I guess I'm not 'SpongeBob SquarePants' anymore. I'll have to start all over again. [cut to Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is talking to Squidward] Hello, sir. I'd like an application, please. My name is SpongeBob Sq... [coughs and grunts] Sorry, I'm a little... [coughs more] I'm a little... [grunts] I'm a little nervous. My name is SpongeBob... RoundPants. And I would like to seek employment at this eating establishment. [Squidward punches himself] Oh, dear! Are you ok, Mr. Cashier? Ooh! [picks up a stack of papers] Here are the applications. [cut to SpongeBob filling them out] Let's see here. "Name." [writes] SpongeBob RoundPants. Well, this is going well. [to Squidward] Hey, Mr. Cashier, looks like we're gonna be coworkers! [Squidward groans] Question two. "Have you ever been convicted of a felony?" Hmm, what's a felony?
Squidward: Being too darn happy all the time!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah! Lots and lots of felonies.
Squidward: [chuckles] Moron.
Mr. Krabs: What's going on here?!
SpongeBob: I'm filling out an application.
Mr. Krabs: Get to work.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Then I got the job?!
Mr. Krabs: [annoyed] Oh boy. [cut to later]
SpongeBob: My first day on the job. I am so excited. Woo-hoo!
Squidward: Whatever.
SpongeBob: [panting] You've worked here a long time. Why don't you show this rookie the ropes?
Squidward: Oh, I'd love to.
SpongeBob: Yay! [grabs Squidward]
Squidward: But...no! Don't... [gets dragged into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: So what do I do first? [pen and notepad in hand]
Squidward: [groans] Fine. Take a Krabby Patty and put it on the grill. [does so]
SpongeBob: Shouldn't you watch it?
Squidward: Why? I don't think it's going anywhere.
SpongeBob: Ooh, very Zen. [Krabby Patty burns] What next, oh, oracle of Krabby wisdom?
Squidward: I'm going to the bathroom.
SpongeBob: Hmm, I'll go, too. [walks into the stall next to Squidward] How's it going in there, boss?
Squidward: Um... fine.
SpongeBob: [writes] Going fine. [Squidward starts snoring] Oh, Mr. Squidward... [under Squidward's stall. Squidward screams] Whatcha reading? [Squidward walks out of the bathroom and SpongeBob follows, writing stuff down] Bathroom break. Check. [cut to later]
Squidward: Here's the slop you ordered. [tosses tray of food down on customer's table] Enjoy. If you can choke it down.
SpongeBob: [writes] Be rude to customers and insult food. Nasally laugh. [cut to later where Squidward throws a bag of trash at the dumpster out back and breaks the bag open. SpongeBob does same. Squidward pats SpongeBob on the head. Cut to later]
Customer: Can I get a Krabby Patty Combo?
Squidward: No.
Customer: How about a Double Krabby?
SpongeBob: No.
Customer: Can I get a Triple Patty with cheese?
SpongeBob: [nudging Squidward] Oh I think you've had way too many of those. [both laugh as the customer walks off angry. Cut to another trash bag broken being thrown at the dumpster. SpongeBob tosses a tray on a customers table, spilling the drinks on the floor]
Squidward: Taught him everything he knows. [more bags of trash being broken and customers getting burnt food or food thrown at them. SpongeBob and Squidward are snoring the bathroom while customers are waiting to use the stalls. Customers are clamoring in line while SpongeBob and Squidward are snoring at the cash register]
Mr. Krabs: What are you two doing?! Get to work! I'm used to Squidward sleeping on the job, but I expect more from you, Mr. SquarePants.
SpongeBob: I am not SpongeBob SquarePants, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: What in the name of Davy Jones are you talking about?
SpongeBob: I mean, do these pants look square to you? They're round.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, so?
SpongeBob: I can't be SpongeBob SquarePants with round pants.
Mr. Krabs: Who told you that?
SpongeBob: Patrick. [cuts to Patrick about to eat, but puts his Krabby Patty down as he realizes his error.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, why don't you just take them off? [cut to SpongeBob bringing out a Krabby Patty in his underwear]
SpongeBob: Order up, Squidward.
Sandy: Well if it isn't SpongeBob UnderPants. [chuckles. SpongeBob notices he's in his underwear and screams]
Plankton: Okay, Karen. Which one's better? [holds up two different napkin designs]
Karen: If I had eyes, I'd be rolling them right now.
Plankton: [sarcastically] Oh, thanks for the help. Ya know, details like this can be very important to the customers.
Karen: Customers? What customers?
Plankton: Well, uh..... [looks on screen and sees car in parking lot] ...like those customers, who just pulled up. [zips outside] Well, hello, gentlemen, and welcome to the Chum Bucket! Would you like seating inside or outside?
Pilar: Seating for what?
Plankton: [angrily] For the Chum Bucket! Where you can enjoy a nice helping of chum. [sarcastically] Oh, boy this is so... [pretends to eat it by hiding it behind his head] ...good. The chum is.
Nat: Wait a minute, eating chum? Do people do that?
Plankton: Look, are you gonna eat or not!?
Nat: Yeah. I'll gonna have two Krabby Patties.
Pilar: Oh yeah, two.
Nat: We couldn't find parking over at the Krusty Krab. [cuts to the Krusty Krab, jam-packed with cars. The two customers walk away]
Plankton: [burst out water from his head then drinks it, then sighs calmly] Now what was I saying? Oh right. [angrily rips up the menu and stamps on it] I'm tired of the Krusty Krab taking all of my business! We're doomed, Karen! Doomed, I tell you! [cries]
Karen: Well, why don't you do what all good business owners do?
Plankton: [still crying] What would that be?
Karen: Advertise your product, of course. [she gives Plankton part of the towel]
Plankton: Advertising? [stops crying] I can't believe it took me so long to come up with this [Karen sighs]
Plankton: [digging in a box of letters] Now let's see, Q no... P no...Ah, here it is, L! There, it's perfect! Chum is metabolic fuel! You really did it this time ol' Planky. Oh yeah, who's a genius. Have you seen this, seen this, seen my genius, genius, genius, genius.♪ [Patrick begins reading the slogan. While this is happening, Plankton stops dancing and looks down at him]
Patrick: Chum is...[sips cup] meh...
Plankton: Hello, sir, and welcome to the Chum Bucket! Er, sir?
Patrick: ...META...A...TAB...TAB...AB...BOL...IC...
Mini Brain Patrick 1: Forget about what that word means! There's a fire breaking out the language lobes!
Mini Brain Patrick 2: We need to get outta here! [Patrick Midget pushes on a door with signs saying "PULL TO OPEN"]
Mini Brain Patrick 3: The door's jammed!
Mini Brain Patrick 2: Push harder! [All start moaning and coughing]
Patrick: ...METAB...BO... [Head starts to smoke]
Plankton: Sir, your head, it's on fire. [Patrick jumps] The drink, use the drink!
Patrick: [Stares at cup] It's kelp juice, you want some? [Plankton takes drink from Patrick and throws it at his head] HEY! What kind of friend are you?
Plankton: Friend? I didn't even know y-
Patrick: Go ahead. Say you're sorry.
Plankton: Uh, I'm sorry?
Patrick: Okay, I forgive you. And...[shakes Plankton's hand] I'm sorry for yelling. Okay, so can I tell you something honestly?
Plankton: Whatever.
Patrick: It's about your sign. These words make my head sad.
Patrick's Head: [cries] I don't get it. [cries more]
Patrick: It's okay, little fella. I don't either.
Plankton: Okay, Freakshow, you just wait. In a few minutes, this sign will attract more than you can count.
Narrator: A few minutes later...
Patrick: Uhh, what's that number before one?
Plankton: Zero.
Patrick: Oh right, congratulations, you have zero customers!
Plankton: Okay, so it may take a little longer than a few minutes.
Narrator: A little longer than a few minutes later...
Patrick: Wait, what are we doing again? [Plankton gets angry. While he does, Patrick switches the letters around on the sign] There we go! Chum is Fum!
Plankton: What the? This says "Chum is Fum." You've changed my sign to "Chum is Fum?" That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Patrick: They seem to think it's interesting. [shows a bunch of customers coming into the the Chum Bucket. Chattering amongst the customers]
Plankton: Apparently, dumb sells chum. And I believe I've just found our Advertising Director. [Patrick chews off a bit of a letter "R." Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [screams] Only two customers? Customers are looking kinda scarce. [Chuckles nervously] Must be low tide or something, eh Squidward?
Squidward: They've all gone to the Chum Bucket.
Mr. Krabs: The Chum Bucket? [He looks through a pair of binoculars and reads the sign above the Chum Bucket door] "Chum...is...Fum?" SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, sir?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, we have a situation.
SpongeBob: I'm on it. [He runs off]
[SpongeBob pulls a lever which activates a "Situation Alert" button. Mr. Krabs is pulled away to his office via a moving plank. Another plank tilts and SpongeBob slides down it. He uses his hat as a parachute and lands in the middle of a target with two closed vents to his left and right. The target turns SpongeBob to the vent on the right and both vents open. A large metal square shaped hand pushes him down the vent]
SpongeBob: [Taking a switch out of his pocket] Five. [A door with the Number 5 on it opens]
SpongeBob: Four. [A door with the number 4 on it opens up]
SpongeBob: Three. [A door with the Number 3 on it opens up]
SpongeBob: Two. [A door with the Number 2 on it opens up]
SpongeBob: One. [A door with the Number 1 on it opens up]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm afraid our worst fears have been realized.
SpongeBob: Ah! Goofy Goober is going non-dairy?
Mr. Krabs: No. [Pulling down a screen]
SpongeBob: Ooh. Slide show.
Mr. Krabs: [Changes slide] A few hours ago, the Chum Bucket was, as it should be, a desolate no-man's land. [Changes slide to a bunch of customers outside the Chum Bucket] There's only one way he could have changed things around so quickly. [Changes slide to Plankton sneaking past SpongeBob] Plankton must have slipped into the Krusty Krab while you weren't looking.
SpongeBob: Hey, that's my legs.
Mr. Krabs: [Changes slide to Plankton stealing the Secret Formula] He stole the formuler. [A slide of SpongeBob screaming is displayed]
SpongeBob: [screams]
Mr. Krabs: I thought you'd say that. [Changes slide to him and SpongeBob sneaking to the Chum Bucket] So we need to infiltrate the Chum Bucket and steal the formular back.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are dressed in a brown-ish jacket with a clam on top. Mr. Krabs is on top of SpongeBob while he is struggling to keep his balance]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, how you holding up boy?
SpongeBob: Not so good, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Hold on now. We're almost there.
Narrator: Two hours later...
Plankton: Next!
Mr. Krabs: We made it, SpongeBob. We're in! [They enter the Chum Bucket. This is chatter among the crowd of customers]
Nat: All I know is: Chum is Fum.
Pilar: You said it. Chum is Fum.
Mr. Krabs: Keep an eye peeled for anything suspiciourous
SpongeBob: [struggling] Like that door? [camera moves to reveal door that has two signs covering windows saying "TOP SECRET" "STAY OUT!"]
Mr. Krabs: Eh...BINGO! Giddy up, boy, We're almost there. [Opens door]
Patrick: Huh?
[Plankton immediately runs up to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs. Door closes]
Plankton: Excuse me, would you like a free sample?
Mr. Krabs: No, uh [clears throat. Changes his voice with a falsetto voice] I'm full, thanks!
Plankton: No? How 'bout your little friend? Hi, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hi! I don't want a free sampl-
Plankton: [Stuffs the Chum in SpongeBob's mouth] Sure you do. Look out! She's gonna blow!
[Disguise expands and camera cuts to the outside of Chum Bucket and shows explosion. Camera cuts back to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs out of disguise]
SpongeBob: Blegh, Aheh, Agh, Agheh [Pulls out tongue and starts scrubbing it]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Well, he obviously didn't steal me formular, but how did he steal all my customers?
Pilar: This chum tastes awful.
Nat: Yeah, but that slogan is so catchy that we can't stop eatin' it.
Nat and Pilar: CHUM IS FUM! [They both throw up]
Plankton: Ah hehehehehehe [takes breath] Chum is fum! Ah he he!
Mr. Krabs: [Takes SpongeBob by the tongue] Come on, SpongeBob...
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs leave scene]
Plankton: I'm gonna see how our advertising guru is doing. [Goes into "top secret room"] What brilliant slogans have you come up with this week, Patrick? [Walks in front of Patrick only to find him asleep]
Patrick: [snore. sleepily] Hm, huh?
Plankton: [facepalms] Gah! You're supposed to be coming up with witty catchphrases to keep that rabble out there happy! [jumps up onto easel] Chum is Fum...We kinda got that one already. [Flips poster paper up to reveal CHUM IS FUM]
Patrick: OOH I like that one!
[Plankton flips poster paper up again to reveal CHUM IS FUM again. Plankton flips poster paper up again to reveal multiple CHUM IS FUM on whole sheet. Plankton flips poster paper up again to reveal CHUM IS FUM together in the shape of Patrick. Flips paper up to reveal CHUM. Flips paper up to reveal IS. Flips paper up to reveal FUM]
Plankton: Agh. Oh well, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. [jumps down] Keep up the good work...I guess...
Patrick: You got it boss!
Plankton: [Opens door to the crowd and announcing] HEY EVERYONE! CHUM IS FUM!
[Crowd cheers. Bubble transition to outside of Chum Bucket showing a line up that goes till the outside]
Plankton: Hey Karen, check this out!
Karen: What now?
Plankton: You see, every time I make a sale the sound goes there, Watch! [Opens cash register. *CHA CHING*. sound goes to microphone outside to 3 loud speakers on top of the Chum Bucket]
Mr. Krabs: [Cries]
Karen: How is that gonna help to boost sales?
Plankton: Karen, babe, you don't need help when you have a catchy slogan like mine.
Karen: Don't look now, but I think your catchy slogan days are numbered.
Plankton: [Turns around and looks at the customers]
Nat: [Barfs on floor] Uhh...something's not right.
Pilar: Yeah, I know, I keep sayin' "Chum is Fum" but it...ehh...it's just not workin'.
Nat: I'm outta here. [Throws ChumStick on the floor and leaves]
Pilar: [Also throws away ChumStick and leaves]
Plankton: Hmmmm....
[Bubble transition to Patrick sleeping]
Plankton: [Shouting] PATRICK!
Patrick: [Wakes up] Huh?!
Plankton: We're having a board meeting here! We need ideas!
Patrick: [examining graph that the line ends inside the toilet] Hmmmm, Mhmmmm, Uh huuuh. I think I see the problem. Your potty has a shocky thing in it!
Plankton: NO! That's not it you FOOL! We need a new slogan! You need to come up with another genius catchphrase like "Chum is Fum"! But different.
Patrick: Oh... Gotcha. Hmmmmmm.
Narrator: 3 days later...
[Cuts to outside of Chum Bucket with a longer line of customers. zooms in on new sign "FUM IS CHUM"]
Nat: I'm so happy that they changed that old tired slogan, "Chum is Fum".
Pilar: Yeah, that new slogan "Fum is Chum" is way cooler.
Nat: Way cooler!
[Nat and Pilar pick up Chum Bucket Supreme and start eating and barfing into their buckets]
Plankton: [Gives bucket of chum to a customer] Here's your Chum Bucket Supreme, enjoy! Patrick, my boy, you really earned that promotion!
Patrick: [Washing dishes] Thanks, boss.
Plankton: Nothing can stop me now!
[Shows montage of Plankton's Success. people eating chum, bilboard posted up with new slogan, being on cover of Bikini Bottom restaurant magazine, many cars parked outside of Chum Bucket, local hockey team lining up for chum]
Plankton: You fellas look hungry, here you go! [Throws the chumsticks at the hockey players and they fight for it]
Patrick: Excuse me, sir. [hands resignation slip] My resignation. [shows picture of himself in fighter plane shooting bullets]
Plankton: But you're my whole marketing department.
Patrick: I know, but I'm "burned out." See? [Turns around to show back of head burned making a hole] Anyway, you can send my check to my home.
Plankton: [rips resignation] Check? You want money for those stupid catchphrases? Anybody can sell to my idiot customers. [over loudspeakers] They're buffoons! Morons! They'll buy anything I sell them. They're the dumbest of the dumb! [Frank and Nancy throw away chum] The stupidest of the stupid! [Debbie Rechid and Susie throw away Chum] They're dummies, dweebs and doodoo dunderheads! I can keep that rabble right where I want 'em! Huh?
Hockey Player: What was that part about doodoo dunderheads, eh?
[Hockey Players beat up Plankton and kick him out of the Chum Bucket]
Hockey Player: Where do you think you're going, little man?
Plankton: Is it too late for sorry? [gets squished on tee] D'OH!
Hockey Player: [chuckles] Hey, check out that new sign at the Krusty Krab. Who's hungry, eh?
[Hockey players cheer and run to Krusty Krab as plankton gets squished]
SpongeBob: Well, Mr. K., we're back in business!
Mr. Krabs: Yep. [shouting at Patrick] Keep up the good work, boy'o!
Patrick: You got it, boss! [Paints "Krabby Patties are Fum" on a banner]
Squidward: Another beautiful Sunday in Bikini Bottom. Nothing can ruin my good mood today!
[SpongeBob looks out of his window]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward: [walks by] Ignoring, ignoring! [cha chas down the street and steps on gum] Chewing gum!? That's disgusting! [pulls his foot away but the gum stays on his foot] Oh, c'mon! [tries pulling it off with his hands but they get stuck, then tries both of them and his head gets stuck. Then uses head and hands but gets even more stuck. He then tries blowing it but it bursts and Squidward gets covered in gum. Tries to get it off again and it turns into a bow-tie and he gets it off] People who litter really bug me! [chucks it] Litterbugs [laughing] Litterbugs!
[gum ends up in front of an police officer, he picks it up, squeezes it, smells it, chews it, blows a bubble, and spits it]
Officer John: Litter!... [sees Squidward] Ah-Ha!
Squidward: [continues laughing] Bugs... litter... litter... bugs
Officer John: Hey, you! Did you throw this gum away?
Squidward: Yes I did, and I like to complain!
Officer John: Ah... So you admit that you are a litterbug?
Squidward: What? No! no no, I just stepped in it!
Officer John: Oh, you sure did, buddy. You disgust me...[Puts the gum in Squidward's mouth and writes a ticket] Maybe this will teach you not to treat the world as your own personal trash can!
Squidward: Bikini Bottom P.D Ticket for littering. Penalty: Community service?!
[camera zooms to a park where people are picking up trash]
Squidward: Stupid Policeman, I'm no litter bug! [sees there's no more trash left] Hey! No more trash! Looks like I'm done!
[camera zooms out a little to show a thug fish]
Thug Fish: Here, you can have mine. [gives his trash to Squidward to clean up]
Squidward: [sighs] Can things get any worse?
Squilliam: Of course they can!
Squidward: Daagh! Squilliam Fancyson! My arch foe from band class!
Squilliam: Stuck doing community service eh? Court ordered?
Squidward: No! I... um... er... volunteering! Yeah, I'm cleaning up Bikini Bottom, selflessly devoting my time to a worthy cause.
Squilliam: Oooh! Maybe if you clean up Bikini Bottom, they'll build a statue of you! Oh, wait! They've already built one... of me! [camera zooms out to show a statue of Squilliam with a trash stick and a trash bag] I cleaned up all of Bikini Bottom in one week.
Mable Monica: Bless you, Squilliam Fancyson! Bless you!
Squidward: [growls] Hmph! I'll clean up Bikini Bottom in a day!
Squilliam: Ooh! Let me help you out [sneezes on a tissue and drops it] There! That should get you started. Tah-tah!
[Officer John walks by,sees the tissue and writes another ticket for Squidward. Squidward is at the main road]
Squidward: Squilliam thinks he sooo amazing! [picks trash] Phew! [wipes his forehead and sees that his trash bag is getting full] Hmmm,I've gotta find some place to dump this litter. [sees a trash can] Oh oh oh! Perfect! [opens it] Full! They're all full! How am I gonna hold all this... [sees a kid with his wagon, thinks and trips him]
Taylor: Whoops!
[Squidward uses the wagon for keeping the trash and an old lady walks out]
Mabel: Oh is it trash day? I thought it was Tuesday!
Squidward: What? No!
Mabel: [puts her trash in the wagon] Hey everybody, it's trash day!
Other Fish: Trash day?! [they start putting their trash in the wagon]
Squidward: Hey! Hold on! Stop! I'm not the garbage man! [there's a lot of trash on the wagon] Help.
[a hand gets out of a bag, unties the string and out comes SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I'll help you Squidward!
Squidward: Why are you in a trash bag?
SpongeBob: I wanted to study the complete life cycle of a Krabby Patty [takes out a Krabby Patty] tch-tch-tch, all alone. Poor guy. [jumps to the ground] I could get rid of your trash, Squidward!
Squidward: No thank you! I'll do it myself.
SpongeBob: Please let me help!
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Please?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Pretty please?
Squidward: No way!
SpongeBob: Pretty please with candy sprinkles on top?
Squidward: Listen closely, I don't need your help! I would rather be beaten to a pulp!
Taylor: That's him, mommy! That's the man who stole my wagon! Beat him to a pulp!
SpongeBob: Hi, lady!
[the muscular mother beats up Squidward, dumps the trash on Squidward and leaves with her son and his wagon. The officer passes by and writes another ticket for Squidward]
SpongeBob: Can I help you now?
Squidward: Alright! Fine! You can help me.
SpongeBob: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! Thank you, Squidward.
Squidward: Well... you gonna help me!?
SpongeBob: First, close your eyeees!
Squidward: Why?
SpongeBob: C'mon!
Squidward: Fine! [closes his eyes] Now what?
SpongeBob: No peeking.
Squidward: Oh brother.
SpongeBob: Ok! You can open your eyes now!
Squidward: Oh this is so stuuuuuu... [sees that the trash has vanished] ...pid. It's gone! Where did you put the trash?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] I put it in...
Squidward: Know what? Don't care! The trash is gone. Thanks, SpongeBob. I hate you a little less now.
SpongeBob: Squidward, that... that's a beautiful thing to say!
[Squidward and SpongeBob walk to their houses]
Squidward: Well, I don't know how you did it, but thank you for getting rid of all that trash. They'll have that statue of me built in no time! [he enters his house which is made out of the trash where is junk kettle is steaming. He pours out nails and bolts into his junk cup. He drinks it and has some junk toast with junk butter. He then has a junky bath and starts to sleep in his junk bed. He then sniffs, realizes all the junk, then screams while running out of the house and gasps] My house!
Officer John: Is this yours?
Squidward: Yes.
[Officer John gives Squidward his fourth ticket. The ticket falls down and the police gives him his fifth ticket]
Officer John: tch-tch-tch, some people never learn [walks away. Squidward's veins crunch up to form 'I AM ANGRY']
SpongeBob: I am angry? Squidward, why are you angry?
Squidward: SpongeBob. What's this?
SpongeBob: Your garbage.
Squidward: Where's my house?
SpongeBob: On top of your garbage. [camera zooms out and shows Squidward's house] The dump was closed. [Squidward sighs] So I bought it here.
Squidward: [sighs again] How?
SpongeBob: Like this. [absorbs all of Squidward's garbage and Squidward gasps] Do you wanna try? [garbage falls out of his mouth]
Squidward: Of all the garbage that comes out of your mouth,this is the least annoying. [laughs and the officer comes and gives him another ticket]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward... [more garbage falls from his mouth and the officer takes out his notepad and pencil]
Squidward: Wait! Zip it! I have an idea! [Squidward goes and comes back with a trash can] Here stand in this. [SpongeBob stands in the bin] See ya sucker! [laughs]
Officer John: Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?
Squidward: Neptune no!
Officer John: [sees the trash can belongs to SpongeBob] So you have the kicks to put your trash in other people's bins, eh? [gives Squidward another ticket. Squidward and SpongeBob walk through the streets]
Squidward: They were gonna make a statue of me! [starts crying in despair]
SpongeBob: Oh, a statue, eh? Hey, Squidward! Look! [shows a blanket which has a figure under it]
Squidward: What is that?!
SpongeBob: Your very own statue!
Squidward: Really?! [SpongeBob throws the cloak away to reveal a smelly statue of Squidward made out of garbage] Garbage. I'm made of garbage
SpongeBob: You sure are!
Squilliam: [laughs] Great job, SpongeBob, you even captured his smell. The scent of failure. [the smell melts Squilliam's statue] My glorious statue!
Officer John: This is your statue?
Squilliam: It was.
[the officer gives Squilliam a ticket]
Squidward: Hhhhhha! Thanks, SpongeBob!
[Officer John coughs to catch Squidward's attention and a can falls down from the statue. The officer gives Squidward and SpongeBob a ticket.]
[In Bikini Bottom, an eerie fog appears, and mysterious singing occurs overnight. SpongeBob wakes up]
SpongeBob: Hey, where's my alarm clock?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Your shell is gone, too?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I think we've been robbed!
Gary: Meow!
[Cuts to Squidward's house]
Squidward: [screams] She's gone! My clarinet has gone missing!
SpongeBob: Hmm, strange indeed...
[Cuts to Patrick's rock]
Patrick: [screams] My cuff links! They're missing! Oh, why? Why? [sobbing]
SpongeBob: I hope this doesn't mean that we're missing the one thing that's nearest and dearest to our heart.
Squidward: Nope, I'm right here.
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab! [cuts to Krusty Krab] Phew.
Squidward: [moans]
SpongeBob: Reporting to duty, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Pearl? what are you doing here?
Pearl: Oh, nothing, SpongeBob. Just trying to juggle schoolwork, having a social life, and running a family business. That's all.
Squidward: Drama queen.
SpongeBob: Where's your dad?
Pearl: I don't know. When I went to get my allowance this morning, he was gone.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is missing?
Squidward: I'm missing my clarinet.
SpongeBob: ...and Gary's shell.
Patrick: Has anyone seen my cuff links?!
Charles: [laughing] So, you lost your cuff links, aye? They're probably in the Bikini Bottom Triangle.
SpongeBob: Bikini Bottom Triangle?
Charles: That's right. First, an eerie fog blows in, [makes noises with tongue] then, you can here the hypnotic song of the mermaids. [makes the noise again] And then, your cuff links are gone. Never to return... [he leaves and laughs]
SpongeBob: The triangle must've taken Mr. Krabs. We gotta find him!
Squidward: Maybe he's doing his morning dumpster dive for change.
[Behind the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you out here?
[An eerie fog appears and the mermaids begin singing]
Squidward: Oh no, is that a mermaid song?
SpongeBob: No, just a thick eerie fog.
[A spotlight appears on SpongeBob and Squidward]
Squidward: Oh no!!
[SpongeBob and Squidward scream and get pulled into the Bikini Bottom Triangle]
SpongeBob: Squidward.
[Squidward shows up in a gumball machine]
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward, stop messing around. We've gotta find Mr. Kra- [sees gumballs] Hey, gumballs! [He chews one and blows a bubble].
Squidward: Oh! This is the Bikini Bottom Triangle? Looks more like a dump.
SpongeBob: Come on, we've gotta find Mr. Krabs. The Krusty Krab needs him. Mr. Krabs? [Squidward trips and bumps into SpongeBob] Squidward, this is no time for seahorseplay!
Squidward: Oh, my neck.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! [very drawn out] Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: Would you shut it already?!
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, Mr. Krabs is gone. I can't take it much longer! Oh, it hurts so bad! I can't take it much longer! I hope he's not in too much pain...where ever he is.
Squidward: Oh, I think Mr. Krabs is doing just fine.
[Shows Mr. Krabs getting a massage]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! You've gotta get up. We gotta get out of here.
Mr. Krabs: Ohh, okay, Tibor, I think I'm good.
Tibor: Remember to drink plenty of fluids.
Mr. Krabs: Look, SpongeBob, you see all this stuff, including you and me, are brought here when the mermaids sing their beautiful song, the mermaids' song triggers this here contraption, to suck this pile like a vacuum. Dumpin' all the contents here on this island, that is how we ended up surrounded. With all this valuable and resellable stuff! [Mermaids begin singing, again] Oh, yippee! Another shipment! Free stuff, here I- come? [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs scream as they are chased by a pile of items] Pretty neat, eh, boy? [Mr. Krabs pulls out Patrick]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Have you found my cuff links?
SpongeBob: No. [Patrick begins eating a Krabby Patty] Patrick, is that a Krabby Patty?
Patrick: Yep. Pearl doesn't make them as good as you do, though.
Mr. Krabs: Pearl? [begins crying] Oh, my sweet little girl, all alone, with me cash register!
Pearl: [off-screen]Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Pearl!
Pearl: Get me out of this trash heap! [Removes her leg before falling to the ground]
Mr. Krabs: [hugs Pearl] Oh, me little angel. Thank you mysterious signing mermaids.
Pearl: Enough with the hugging!
SpongeBob: That's it, Mr. Krabs! I'll just find the mysterious singing mermaids and ask them how to get out of here!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are climbing a large hill]
Patrick: Ah, riding by piggy-back is exhausting.
SpongeBob: You're telling me. [falls]
Patrick: [hits the ground]Whoa.
[Shows five mermaids sitting on top of a hill]
Mermaid #1: I love this mirror, girls, but it is soo ten minutes ago.
Mermaid #2: Like, I couldn't agree with you more.
Mermaid #3: Yeah, like all this stuff is old news.
Mermaid #4: Shall we ladies?
All mermaids: [clear throats. begin singing]
Patrick: Ah, excuse me, hi.
Mermaid #4: Umm, can I help you?
Patrick: [laughs and waves]
SpongeBob: Yes, mermaid ladies, you actually can help us.
Patrick: [laughs] Yeah...
SpongeBob: Yeah, we'd like to know how to get out of here, please.
Mermaid #4: Like, this is the Bikini Bottom Triangle, nothin ever leaves. Duh.
SpongeBob: Uhh, are you sure?
Mermaid #4: Look, little freakazoid, we only know one thing, and that's how to surround ourself with cool new stuff whenever we feel like it, anything beyond that is T.N.O.P.
SpongeBob: T.N.O.P?
Mermaid #4: Uh, yeah. You know, Totally Not Our Problem.
SpongeBob: Oh, T.N.O.P! Okay, well, thanks anyway. Come on, Patrick, let's go. Patrick?
Patrick: [laughs] You go ahead, SpongeBob. I think I'm gonna hang with the ladies a bit. [laughs. Cuts to Mr. Krabs using a metal detector]
Mr. Krabs: Come on. Come on. I know you're in there! [finds a quarter] Ah ha, playing hard to get, weren't you little one?
Quarter: Little one? How dare you, sir!
SpongeBob: I'm back, Unfortunately, I was unable to get the information from the- [passes out]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? SpongeBob, boy-o! SpongeBob, can you hear me?
Pearl: Should we help?
Squidward: He looks fine to me.
Mr. Krabs: What's the matter, boy-o? [gasps] Your Krabby Patty meter is on empty! We've got to get a Krabby Patty into you quick or- [the mermaids sing again] Please great vacuum cleaner, please just give us just one- [notices a Krabby Patty at the top of the pile. gasps] ...Krabby Patty. [puts the patty into SpongeBob's mouth]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah!! Wow, sir, that was the single best Krabby Patty I've ever eaten.
Mr. Krabs: Why, thank you, boy-o. I'm glad you- Wait a minute, I didn't make that Krabby Patty, and you didn't make that Krabby Patty, and those two couldn't have made it, so it must have been that rotten pipsqueak Plankton! I've gotta stop that poor excuse for a life form from- So, how do we get out of here?
SpongeBob: Well, sir, based on what the mermaids told me, there er... there is no way out.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, really? Well, I think you don't know who to talk to the ladies.
SpongeBob: Well, sir, I-
Mr. Krabs: Look, boy, I've got a way with the ladies, and I guarantee the old Krabs charm, will have them telling us exactly how to get out of here. [cuts to the Mermaids] So there's really no way out of this place? I really need to get back to the Krusty Krab to stop my arch-nemesis from ruining my business.
Mermaid #4: T.N.O.P, Grandpa.
Mr. Krabs: T.N.O.P?
SpongeBob: [to Mr. Krabs] Totally Not Our Problem.
Mermaid #4: Oh, and P.S, here's you creepy pink friend back.
[They throw Patrick and he lands on Mr. Krabs]
Pearl: Daddy! Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, Pearl, daddy's okay. [Mr. Krabs tosses Patrick off]
Pearl: Can I go to the mall now?
Mr. Krabs: The mall? But, Pearl-
Pearl: I wanna go to the mall! [starts crying while the mermaids are confused by this.]
Mermaid #4: Like, what's a mall?
Pearl: Wait what? You seriously don't know what a mall is?
Mermaid #4: I am seriously, serious.
Pearl: Well, the mall is only like the most awesome place to get the best, super-coolish, glittershly fabulous new stuff you want!
Mermaid #4: Really?
Mermaid #3: No way!
Mermaids #1, #2, and #5: We want to go to the mall!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, do you?
All Mermaids: Uh-huh!
Mr. Krabs: Now, how do you propose we do that, huh? Wait, I know we just hit the magic reverse button on the giant vacuum cleaner.
SpongeBob: That's it, sir! It's the mermaids!
Mr. Krabs: It sure is, what?
SpongeBob: The reverse switch is the mermaids, they just need to sing their song, backwards.
Mermaid #4: Yeah! Backwards!
[All Mermaids clear throats and sing backwards]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, backwards, what a stupid idea that-
[everbody yells in surprise. The ground starts shaking and the vacuum cleaner sucks in everything on the island and transports them back to Bikini Bottom]
Pearl: You ready for the mall, girls?
All Mermaids: Yeah! The mall! The mall! The mall! The mall!
Squidward: Hello, miserable life, I'm back.
[Some Bikini Bottomites come to the pile]
Old Fish: My dentures!
Gray fish: Tibor! You're alive!
SpongeBob: Isn't that great, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is reclaiming their stuff.
[Mr. Krabs walks away]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Speaking of reclaiming... alright Plankton, I know what you're up to but, the jigs up you little conniving pipsqueak! Huh?
[Charles from the beginning is cooking at the grill.]
Charles: Actually, the name's Charles. Figured I'd hold down the fort, for ya' while you were gone.
Mr. Krabs: So, you've been the one making me Krabby Patties?
Charles: Yep. All me. Oh, and by the way, you've got a little vermin problem.
Plankton: [in glass jar] Vermin? You take that back!
Charles: He's a feisty one...
Patrick: Hey! I found my cuff links! [puts them in and is shown in a suit] That's better. Good day, gentlemen.
[Patrick gets into a limo and drives away]
Patrick: Home, Reginald.
SpongeBob: Patrick! You forgot your cummerbund!
[In the Krusty Krab Freezer, SpongeBob opens the door. He enters the room. He starts to shiver. While shivering, he passes by a frozen skeleton. He stops at a box. He looks down and screams. As he screams, the scene cuts to Squidward looking through the order window. It cuts to the dining area, where Harold, Dave, Frankie Billy, and Debbie look up from their meals. It cuts to Mr. Krabs' office, where he is stacking some money, but the scream makes it fall. It cuts back to the freezer. Mr. Krabs runs to the door.]
Mr. Krabs: What is it, boy?
[SpongeBob babbles. The light turns on and SpongeBob points to the box.]
Mr. Krabs: [While walking over to SpongeBob and SpongeBob still pointing and babbling] SpongeBob? [Mr. Krabs stops walking. He grabs an oxygen tank and puts it over SpongeBob's mouth. SpongeBob stops babbling and starts taking deep breaths.] There, there, kid. What's the big deal?
[Mr. Krabs tosses the oxygen tank.]
SpongeBob: M-M-M-M-Mr. Krabs! [The scene cuts to the empty box.] We're all out of Krabby Patties, sir.
[The scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: That's nothing to fuss over, boy. We'll just whip up a new batch, like we did in the old days!
[The scene changes to show a cauldron in Mr. Krabs' office. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are surrounding it.]
Mr. Krabs: I know this process like the back of me claw. [He grabs behind him for something.] We always start with... [He holds up an opened bag of flour.] ...flour. [He pours in the flour.] Next, we add [He lifts up some barnacle shavings.] barnacle shavings. It's like riding a boat-cycle, ain't it, boy?
[Mr. Krabs pours in the barnacle shavings.]
SpongeBob: You never forget, boss man.
Mr. Krabs: What do ya say we do the next one together, eh?
Mr. Krabs: [While holding up a jar of sea salt] Sea Salt.
SpongeBob: [While holding up a jar of turmeric] Turmeric.
Mr. Krabs: What are you on about, boy? Third step's always sea salt.
SpongeBob: That's funny, I remember turmeric third. And doesn't the recipe call for land salt?
Mr. Krabs: It's sea salt. And don't you remember SCABS?
SpongeBob: Scabs, sir?
[While bubbles reading, "S.C.A.B.S." appear] Yeah, SCABS. You know, [As he pops eac of the bubbles.] "salt comes after barnacle shavings." [While bubbles reading, "L.E.S.I.O.N.S." appear] Or was it LESIONS? Or wait... [As the bubbles for LESIONS float away] No, that doesn't sound right either.
SpongeBob: Was it pustule?
Mr. Krabs: Heavens, no. That's disgusting. All right, tell you what, why don't I just go fetch the formula? We'll settle this once and for all.
[Mr. Krabs walks over to his safe, humming. He opens it up. Plankton, who is holding the secret formula bottle and on a rocket, flies out of the safe. He laughs.]
Plankton: No need to wonder about this. I got your formula. [He laugh. He pulls out a cowboy hat and hits it on the rocket.] Yee-haw!
[Plankton stops and flies backwards. The scene shows Mr. Krabs holding a magnet, which has the rocket, which has Plankton, who is holding the formula bottle, on it.]
Mr. Krabs: Aren't you getting a little tired of this, Plankton?
[Mr. Krabs shakes the magnet and the bottle falls into his other claw.]
Plankton: Come on, Krabs, don't you have any respect for tradition?
[Mr. Krabs, who is holding the rocket, which has Plankton on it, goes to the front door.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, ho, ho, ho, Of course, I do. That's why I'm doing this.
[Mr. Krabs lets go of the rocket and it flies into a Chum Bucket front door window.]
Plankton: Ow.
[The scene cuts to inside the dining area of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs walks up to SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: I need to somehow get Plankton to stop comin' after me precious formula.
SpongeBob: Hmm, I know! To keep Gary out of the biscuit tin, I hide the biscuits somewhere far away, like Patrick's house. Unfortunately, Patrick ends up eating the biscuits anyway.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, that's it, you genius. You just solved me decades-old dellemer.
[Mr. Krabs runs away.]
SpongeBob: [Yelling] I'm warning you, Mr. Krabs, Patrick'll eat anything you give him.
[The scene cuts to a TV with Elaine on it. There is also a card that reads, "Bikini Bottom Special Report".]
Elaine: Breaking news! [The card changes to show Mr. Krabs holding the recipe bottle.] Earlier today, Mr. Eugene Krabs, proprietor of the Krusty Krab restaurant, parted [The card changes to show the formula slightly above Mr. Krabs' claw, tilted, and the "thumb" part of his claw extended further.] with his beloved secret formula. We now go to Perch Perkins live on the scene.
[The scene changes to show Perch Perkins outside the Krusty Krab.]
Perch Perkins: Thanks, Elaine. Just moments ago, Eugene Krabs sent his famously delicious secret Krabby Patty formula packing.
[The scene cuts to show Mr. Krabs, who is holding the formula bottle, and SpongeBob outside of a truck, which contains a safe. They are in tears.]
Mr. Krabs: Take care of yourself, little formula.
[Mr. Krabs puts the formula bottle into the safe and closes it. The truck's backdoor then shuts. It is escorted by two highway patrol officers inside a Bikini Bottom Movers truck. It drives onto a platform with wheels, which is attacked to a subway front car. It goes for a while until the platform is lift by a helicopter, which lifts it into a cargo plane. The plane then flies away. The scene cuts to SpongeBob, holding Perch Perkins microphone.]
SpongeBob: [While crying] Good-bye, secret recipe!
Perch Perkins: [While struggling to get the microphone out of SpongeBob's hands.] We wanted to ask Mr. Eugene Krabs [He manages to get the microphone free.] what compelled him to take such drastic measures.
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's simple, Perch. [The scene cuts to a TV screen with Mr. Krabs on it.] It seems keeping me secret formula in hand has proven to be all too temptin' for a [He turns towards the camera.] certain diminutive one-eyed criminal element of society.
[The scene pans out to reveal that the TV is being watched by Plankton in the Chum Bucket.]
[As the TV turns off] So, I finally got him in full retreat.
[Plankton evilly laughs. The scene returns to Mr. Krabs' office, where Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are around the cauldron.]
Mr. Krabs: All right, boy, let's get back to making them patties.
SpongeBob: I believe we were at turmeric.
Mr. Krabs: Boy, I thought I told you--
SpongeBob: Oh, no we forgot to look at the...
Mr. Krabs: Formula, yeah.
SpongeBob: And that formula is...
Mr. Krabs: On the opposite side of the ocean, yeah. [He groans. He walks to the wall, which has the door.] And now I've gotta go [While hitting his head on the wall] all [not hitting his head] the way [While hitting his head] there [not hitting his head] to [While hitting his head] get it.
[SpongeBob walks over to Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'll do it. Send me to retrieve that formula.
Mr. Krabs: Think you're up for the challenge?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Mr. Krabs: Well, all right then, [He grabs SpongeBob by the side.] the formula is now stowed in a safe-deposit box in the ocean's largest, safest bank [He grabs a key.] in Way-far-out-town-ville.
SpongeBob: Ah, and that's the key to the box, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: This, No. This is the key to me heart? [He pulls down his shirt, revealing a locked door on his chest. He then uses the key on it and opens the door. It shows his heart. Mr. Krabs puts his hand into his chest and takes out another key.] This is the safe-deposit box key.
SpongeBob: [While grabbing for the key] Oh, thank you Mr.--
Mr. Krabs: [While pulling it away] Not so fast, kid. I want you to protect this at all costs. You mustn't let it out of your sight. I now bestow unto you the key to the future of The Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: I humbly accept this key and vow to guard it with my very life. (takes the key) It shan't leaveth my sight.
Mr. Krabs: (Plankton hears the conversation with some technology of his) Good, let's get you over at the train station.
Plankton: This is too easy. Karen, I'm off on a business trip. Don't up wait for me, baby. (cuts to train station)
SpongeBob: The Oceanic Express. (train whistles) Wish me luck.
Mr Krabs: Remember what I told you, boy? Keep your eye on the key.
Oran J. Roughy: I can take your luggage for you, sir. (grabs Patrick) Please follow me.
SpongeBob: Wow, a real-life butler.
Oran J. Roughy: I am not a butler.
Train Conductor: All aboard!
SpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Good luck, me boy! Don't let me down! (train starts to leave as a bus drives up)
Plankton: (gets out of bus and runs up to the train) Wait! Wait for me! (sighs) Barnacles, I knew I should have sprung for a taxi! Curse you public transport! Why I oughta-- (train steam sends Plankton onto the road when a bus immediately smashes him) Oh, now they're on time... Uh-uh... (cut to inside of train)
Oran J. Roughy: Your sleeping quarters. (tosses Patrick in there) I trust everything is to your liking.
SpongeBob: Couldn't be better, butler.
Oran J. Roughy: Ahem. Perhaps Monsieur did not hear me. I trust everything is to your liking.
SpongeBob: Oh, oh yes, of course! How silly of me.
Oran J. Roughy: An honest mistake, monsieur.
SpongeBob: Thank you, my good man. (hands the butler a used, plastic burrito wrapper) I've been hunting for a trash can for at least ten minutes. Thanks again, French guy.
Patrick: Peek-a-boo!
SpongeBob: Hey Patrick, remember, we're on an important mission here. So keep your eyes open for any suspicious characters.
Patrick: (Patrick's reflection in the mirror gets an angry face while the real Patrick asks SpongeBob a question) SpongeBob, does that guy look suspicious to you? (looks back at the reflection) I think he might be spying on us. (Patrick's reflection goes away) Hey, where'd he go!? All this suspicious thing is making me hungry.
SpongeBob: Well, then follow me to the dining car.
Plankton: (climbs on top of a bus) Looks like it's starting to roll my way for a change. And nothing dares stand in my way! (Plankton jumps) Uh-oh. (An 18-wheeler blocks his way and he splatters on the windshield. The driver is disgusted by the large green smear and turns on the wipers to scrape squashed Plankton off. He floats on down to the train) I knew I'd make it... (cut to the dining car)
SpongeBob: Ooh Fancy.
Patrick : Yeah. And they gave you so much food, you need 2 forks. (baby heard crying)
SpongeBob: Aw, what a cute little baby. No need to fuss, little fella.
Nanny: I just can't get him to stop crying. The poor dear.
SpongeBob: (sits down) Hi again, kind butler.
Employee: (sighs) So sorry monsieur. The dining car is closed now.
SpongeBob: (looks at watch) But we haven't even heard the specials yet.
Employee: No, the dining car is over for you. You must leave now. (pushes SpongeBob away. He trips over a purse. A lady picks him up)
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, ma'am.
Miss McGuffin: That's quite alright, handsome. (cut to a train terrace)
SpongeBob: Huh, friendly lady. Well, Patrick, we'd better find a safe place to store this for the night. (SpongeBob is holding the key but it's not there)
Patrick: What is that?
SpongeBob: That my dear Patrick is—the key! (sees it missing) Patrick, where is the key? Oh, no, I took a solemn oath. (Plankton is walking by angrily)
SpongeBob: Plankton! You stole the safety-deposit key.
Plankton: Oh, come on, I just got here. I couldn't have stolen it—yet.
SpongeBob: Oh yeah? Well no offense, but I don't believe you.
Plankton: You calling me a liar?
SpongeBob: Yes. Search him, Patrick.
Patrick: (puts on latex gloves) With pleasure. Prepare for a thorough search, shorty.
Plankton: Oh, drat.
Patrick: (picks up bowl) Just after I scrub this bowl. (scrubs bowl) Alright, Plankton, time to squeeze the key out of you. (takes out some clamps. Plankton gasps) After my tasty snack. (uses the clamp to crush the nut. Plankton runs and screams) He's clean. (drops Plankton)
Plankton: (grunts) I told you I wasn't lying.
SpongeBob: Well, if you didn't steal it, then who did? It must've been someone on this train. Patrick, call the cops.
Patrick: (puts his head out the window) Cops, I need you! (cut to the Krusty Krab)
Crowd: (chanting) We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties!
Customer: Just give me a patty, man.
Squidward: For the last time, we're out of patties. (customers shout) No need to get excited now.
Customer: We want our patties, man. (destroys the cash register)
Squidward: That's Krusty Krab property. (another customer rips off a pole) That's a load-bearing column. (customer swings the pole at Squidward. He ducks) Hurry, SpongeBob. (cut to train being stopped and all riders are outside the train)
SpongeBob: As you know, an unspeakable crime has been committed here today and each of you have the means to do it. The question is who? You there, you're not fooling me with that innocent act. (SpongeBob points at the baby) Where were you at 6:42pm on the night of January 16? And don't give me that goo-goo-ga-ga stuff.
Plankton: Oh brother.
SpongeBob: Mr. Police Commissioner?
Commissioner: Yes, Mr. SquarePants?
SpongeBob: I sub-- (turns around and walks into the policeman) I submit to you that the perpetrator of this heinous theft is none other than...the nanny.
Nanny: (nervous chuckling) I haven't stolen a thing.
SpongeBob: Sir, if you search this baby's diaper, you'll find the stolen key.
Commissioner: Yes, Mr. SquarePants. (uses tongs to dig into the diaper. A metal sound clinks) Aha!
SpongeBob: The key!
Commissioner: (uses tongs to take out a huge diamond) At least I found it. Thank you, Mr. SquarePants. You uncovered Neptune's jewel of the sea and nabbed the infamous Jewel Triplets Gang.
SpongeBob: Triplets?
Baby Triplet: (deep voice) I told you taking the train was a mistake.
Triplet #2: (reveals himself being the legs of the nanny) Well, we wouldn't be on the lam if you hadn't applied for that discount card.
Baby Triplet: Well, can I help it if I'm frugal?
Commissioner: Tell it to your cellmate, junior. (handcuffs the baby)
SpongeBob: If they didn't do it...that means the key was stolen by...the butler.
Oran J. Roughy: (sighs) I certainly did not.
SpongeBob: We know you did it. The butler always commits the crime.
Oran J. Roughy: For the last time, I am not a butler. I don't even have the butler accent.
Patrick: You may not be a butler, but are you a werewolf? (there is a full moon. A fish walks up and grows hair and changes into a werewolf. He howls and runs off)
Plankton: Okay, butler, you may have hoodwinked the sponge, but I ain't no pushover! (gets hit with a piece of popcorn from Patrick)
Patrick: Sorry. (chomps on his popcorn)
Plankton: Anyway, since you didn't steal the key, then you'd obviously submit to a search of your cabin.
Oran J. Roughy: I do not have a cabin. I sleep on the luggage.
Plankton: Aha, that's how you stole it! Give it to me. Give me the key.
SpongeBob: Need I remind you, Plankton, that you are still a suspect yourself.
Plankton: Uh, I-I mean, give SpongeBob back the key.
SpongeBob: I don't believe either of you. Shake 'em down. (a big muscular police officer comes and turns the butler upside-down and shakes him. Plankton falls on the ground and gets hit with a nail clipper, a hammer, and an anvil from the butler's pockets)
Keystone Cop: Nothing suspicious here. (the butler's mask falls off) Except for the fact that you just outed Oran J. Roughy, international fugitive wanted for the embezzlement of over 75,000 bucks worth of ham sandwiches. (Patrick screams)
SpongeBob: After all this, I still haven't found the key and I broke my vow to Mr. Krabs. (sobs) I don't deserve to work at the Krusty Krab.
Patrick: (picking his teeth with the key) Don't worry, buddy. I'm sure it'll turn up.
SpongeBob: The key! Patrick! Where in the ocean's depth did you find it?
Patrick: I found it when I was cleaning your shorts from your little "accident" earlier.
SpongeBob: Well, that is great news.
Patrick: (yawns) Anyways, I'm gonna hit the sack. I'm pooped. I'm sure you can relate.
SpongeBob: Uh, yeah, me, too. (runs up into the train)
Plankton: (hiding behind the door hinges) Me, three. (laughs. Cut to the train moving. SpongeBob and Patrick are grunting as they try to get cozy in their very tight space of cabin)
Patrick: Say, would you mind scooching over? I can't even move my eyebrows.
SpongeBob: I'm trying. Sheesh, this isn't exactly a luxury suite.
Plankton: Here, maybe I can help. (opens window. SpongeBob and Patrick stick out their tongues like dogs)
SpongeBob: (sighs) Fresh water.
Patrick: What a cool view.
Plankton: Yeah, have a better look. (hits them both with a 2x4, sending them out of the train and down a sandy hill. Train whistles) And thanks for the key!
Patrick: Well, I guess he lost us. You ready to call it a day, SpongeBob? (SpongeBob runs off) Guess not. (runs after him)
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, on the count of three, we'll jump on, okay?
Patrick: Gotcha, pal. Oh, wait, I can't count that high. Can we just jump on the count of one?
SpongeBob: That'll work, too. Okay, on the count of one—what the? (they come to a cliff. The train is still riding off)
Patrick: Great, now what?
SpongeBob: Patrick, hop up on my back.
Patrick: Well, I don't think this is the right time for a piggyback ride.
SpongeBob: Just do it.
Patrick: Okay. But I don't see how this is gonna get us any closer to the tr-- (screams. SpongeBob jumped off the cliff) Are you crazy?! Please! I'm sorry for any grief I've caused you! Don't do it, please! (crying. SpongeBob flips onto Patrick's back and turns himself into a hang-glider) Hey, we're flying!
SpongeBob: There you go, buddy. (sets Patrick on top of the train. They both go into the train in search of Plankton) Oh, Plankton!
Patrick: You can't hide forever. (both yelp as a bunch of luggage falls on them)
Plankton: Looks like you've got a lot on your mind. (Plankton runs off. SpongeBob and Patrick chase after him through many train doors of the caboose and the coaches and head through the coal tender and enter the engine's cabin)
SpongeBob: Alright, Plankton, end of the line! (sees the train controls, only to find that Plankton is not there) Plankton!
Plankton: Over here, choo-choo heads. (laughs as he closes the door and then separates the train by uncoupling the tender, coaches, and caboose from the engine)
Patrick: That was odd.
SpongeBob: Yeah, and Plankton still has the key. (sees the head of the train getting farther away from the rest of it) Patrick, we've got a big problem. Look.
Patrick: Hey, where'd all those—those shiny tubes?
SpongeBob: That's just it, Patrick, they aren't there.
Patrick: Hmm. In that case... (both he and SpongeBob scream. Back to the other train parts with the tender, coaches, and caboose)
Fish #1: Hey, what's going on?
Fish #2: I've got places to be.
Fish #3: Let's go already!
Plankton: (opens one of the train doors and we see Far-Out-Ville and the bank across the way) It's too easy. (back to the head of the train)
SpongeBob: Patrick, we have to stop this thing! Go see if you can do something with that stuff. I'll try and get the door open.
Patrick: What do I do? What do I do? (reads the brake signal) B-R-A-K-E. BRAKE. I can do that. Well, SpongeBob, I think our troubles are over. (shows the brake signal in his hand that he just broke)
SpongeBob: (peers back and screams in fear when he sees that Patrick has broken the brake signal off) You broke the brake?
Patrick: It told me to.
SpongeBob: What do we do now? (starts pushing the buttons and messing around with the controls) Oh, one of these thingama-hoozies has to stop the train. Patrick, try something!
Patrick: I'm on it. (starts shoveling coal into the engine's firebox) Maybe shoveling in these black rocks will help. (The train engine overheats and runs out of control as if it might fall apart. At a train signal station, SpongeBob and Patrick signal for help over the radio)
SpongeBob & Patrick: We're on an out-of-control train! (man spits out his coffee)
Man: This is control station to engine five. Do you copy?
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, yes, sir. I copy. I'm SpongeBob and I'm on an out-of-control train.
Man: Kid, let me talk to the engineer.
SpongeBob: Um, who?
Man: The guy driving the train.
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, th-that would be me. And Patrick's here, too. Say hi to the nice gentleman, Patrick.
Patrick: Hi.
SpongeBob: Oh, the back of the train is gone!
Man: Oh, no. (looks at map) The train's headed straight for the rest home. (picture of Rest Home) And that means...
SpongeBob: Means what? Means what? What does that mean, mister?
Man: (snaps on helmet) It means that train's coming right through that-- (the train engine crashes through the train depot) Beware the twisted trestles, kid! (lets go of the train engine)
SpongeBob: What is that?
Man: (points) That's that. (the train engine does some loop-de-loops. SpongeBob and Patrick cheer and laugh)
SpongeBob & Patrick: (sigh) That was fun.
Patrick: Now, where were we? Oh, yeah. I'll save us! (runs faster than the engine and holds up a 'STOP' sign. The train keeps going. Patrick tries again but uses a lemonade stand) Ice-cold lemonade! Get your ice-cold, tasty, refreshing, and also ice-cold lemon... (groans. The train engine passes by) Hey! Everyone stops for free lemonade! (runs past the train again)
SpongeBob: 'Attaboy, Patrick. Don't give... (Patrick puts down a giant piece of coral rock. The overheating engine flips around and slides on the tracks)
Patrick: Hey. Hey, wait for me... (climbs into the engine's cabin) Hey, SpongeBob! (the train engine crashes through a tunnel)
SpongeBob: Whoa! Whoa! (the overheating train engine is getting near the Rest Home)
Rest Home Citizen: There's a train behind you.
Rest Home Citizen #2: How many times do you think I'm falling for that one?
Patrick: Hey, would you quit messing around? You're making me sick. (the train engine stops before hitting the Rest Home. One of the citizens peeks at the other ones cards)
Rest Home Citizen #2: Hey! (SpongeBob and Patrick sigh)
SpongeBob: Sorry, oldsters, we'd love to stay and help you clean up the mess, but we've got a formula to save. (the train engine starts again but back toward Far-Out-Ville)
Patrick: Hmm. (reads the throttle letters) T-H-R-O-T-T-L-E. Brake! I can do that. (breaks the throttle handle. Walks up to SpongeBob) You didn't need this, did you? (The engine starts to increase its speed and go faster and faster. Cut to the bank)
Plankton: Hee hee hee hee hee. Ha ha ha ha ha. (uses ladder to get up to the safe-deposit box) Come to papa! (opens box and gets formula) At last, my day of triumph has come! Again.
Mr. Krabs: Well, well. (turns on a light)
Plankton: What? B-b-but how?
Mr. Krabs: You honestly didn't think I would have left you out of this elaborate equation, did you?
Plankton: I can explain, Eugene. I, uh, I was just keeping it warm for you. Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: (laughs) Sure. I believe ya. (grabs Plankton) Say, since you went through all the trouble of getting here, there you go, Plankton. (as he puts Plankton in his safe-deposit box, Plankton jumps out and gets the formula) Enjoy the scenery. Hey, where'd he go?
Plankton: Checkmate, Krabs! (laughs evilly. The runaway engine runs into the bank and squishes Plankton) Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Good job, boyo.
SpongeBob: I simply refused to fail, sir.
Bank Teller: (clears throat) That's all very wonderful, but do you mind telling me how you intend to pay for the damage to the bank?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... You know, I just remembered, I'm late for a very important meetin'! Take care of it, will ya boy?
Bank Teller: (grabs Mr. Krabs) Not so fast, Krabs. Looks like you have just enough in your bank account to cover the cost.
Mr. Krabs: Noooooooooooooooo!
Narrator: 75 years later...
SpongeBob: (now old and in a futuristic Bikini Bottom) And that was the story of the great train caper. Didn't you find it exciting?
SpongeBob's Grandson: (playing a game) Shh! I just beat my high score! Oh, yeah!
SpongeBob: Kids today. (snores)
[The Krusty Krab is shown and pans to the inside. Squidward is reading a magazine and hears a whale song. He looks in the kitchen and found out it was Patrick]
Patrick: [calls the whale song again]
SpongeBob: [chatters in dolphin. Patrick and SpongeBob then make the noises several more times]
Squidward: Can you two be quiet?!
[SpongeBob and Patrick struggle not to make the noises again, but end up doing so again, knocking Squidward off his feet]
Squidward: Didn't think so. What are you barnacle heads doing, anyway?
SpongeBob: Patrick and I are practicing our favorite noises. Mine is a dolphin, laughing. [chatters again]
Patrick: And my favorite is the plaintiff song of the blue whale. Ahem. [calls the whale song. Two businessmen are walking down a street and one is a whale, who hears the song]
Whale Businessman: Huh? Did you hear that?
Fish Businessman: What's wrong, Frank?
Frank: [The Whale Businessman] That song. It sounds just like Martha!
Fish Businessman: Frank, how many times do I have to tell you? Martha's no good for you! She's just no good!
[cuts back to Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Why would you want to practice such horrible sounds?
SpongeBob: It's one of the activities in our favorite magazine. [Holds up a magazine] Simple-Ton: A ton of simple things to do!
Squidward: It must very challenging for you!
SpongeBob: Oh, it is.
Patrick: Yeah, and it made me look more smart-like. [Goes cross-eyed] What does the magazine say we should do next?
SpongeBob: Well, let's take a look. [Opens book] I think we've done everything in this issue. Oh, except for this one! The Best Friend Quiz! Do you really know your best friend? Oh, this should be easy. Patrick and I know everything about each other!
Squidward: Well, you two have fun with your mutual ignominious society. [Walks away from window]
SpongeBob & Patrick: Bye, Squidward!
Squidward: [Comes back to window] Morons. [Goes away again]
SpongeBob & Patrick: Bye, again!
SpongeBob: You go first, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, no. After you, old buddy.
SpongeBob: Au contraire. After you, mon amie.
Patrick: Please. After you, pal.
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no. After you, bestest friend- [a boot is thrown at his head] -Oof!
Squidward: [off-screen] Just pick one! And there's another three where that came from!
SpongeBob: I'll go first. [puts on glasses] Question 1: What is your best friend's favorite color? Hmmm.... I'm thinking........Aquamarine!
Patrick: I hate to burst your bubble, but my favorite color is........ it is aquamarine. Sorry I doubted you.
SpongeBob: No problem. Is your best friend right, or left-handed? The answer is right-handed.
Patrick: [draws "Patrick is awesome" on the Wall] How did you know?
SpongeBob: Simple, Patrick! It's because you're my best friend!
Patrick: Aww!
SpongeBob: Is your best friend's belly button have an innie or an outie?
Patrick: [gasps and grabs boat with Squidward in it] No peeking!
SpongeBob: [Laughs] No need to peek, Patrick. I can do this with my eyes closed! [closes eyes and thinks] You haaaaaaaaaave...
Patrick: Oh! What will his answer be?
Squidward: [sarcastically] The suspense is killing me!
SpongeBob: ...an innie!
Patrick: Well, let's just check that theory! [Looks down at his belly button and sees he's an innie] Innie! [Echoes] Wow! How does he do it?
Squidward: [monotonously] Magic. [takes boat and walks away]
Patrick: My turn! But, give me some hard questions. Not like those softballs you answered.
SpongeBob: Okay! First question: What is your best friend's favorite color?
Patrick: Aw, man! Pulling out the big guns. Color. Color.
SpongeBob: [gasps to give Patrick a hint]
Patrick: No, no! No hints! [Struggles] Blue! No, clear! No! [slaps himself in the face] That's not it. Hold on, hold on. 14.
SpongeBob: The answer is...beige.
Patrick: Oh, barnacles! Oh, I was so close.
SpongeBob: Question 2: Is your best friend left-handed or right-handed?
Patrick: [paces back and forth] Oh, tricky, tricky. Hmm, right, or, left? Right-handed!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I'm ambidextrous! [grows another pair of arms]
Patrick: Oh, fish paste!
SpongeBob: Next question: Does your best friend have an innie, or an outie belly button?
Patrick: Belly button, huh? Hmm. An innie!
[there is a loud buzzer that comes when there is a wrong answer to a question]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick. I have an outie. [Shows SpongeBob's outie belly button]
Patrick: Tartar sauce!
SpongeBob: Well, I'm sure you'll get the next one right! What is your best friend's favorite food?
Patrick: Uh...
SpongeBob: [holds up a sign that says "Krabby Patty" in one hand, and an actual Krabby Patty in the other]
Patrick: Oh! Oh! I remember! Your favorite food is a chum burger!
SpongeBob: [Frowns and puts down sign and Krabby Patty] No.
Patrick: I thought for sure I had that one.
SpongeBob: Okay, let's try an easy one. Is your best friend a boy or a girl?
Patrick: Ooh. That's a toughie. [Eyes SpongeBob's muscles] Hmm. Rugged biceps. [inspects SpongeBob's eyes] Yet, delicate eyelashes. Pass!
SpongeBob: [his work hat deflates. He clears his throat] Uh, last question!
Patrick: [claps hands] Ooh! This is for the win!
SpongeBob: What shape is your best friend?
Patrick: Oh! I got this one! Um, uh, can you repeat the question?
SpongeBob: What shape is your best friend, SpongeBob SQUAREPANTS?
Patrick: Round, flat, uh, hexagon.
SpongeBob: SQUARE-pants.
Patrick: Ooh! It's right on the tip of my tongue!
SpongeBob: [Holds up a timer] Five seconds.
Patrick: [shouts] Um, um, oh, jeez, trapezoid, pentagon, mormorphis...
SpongeBob: Time's up! [timer rings]
Patrick: Triangle!
SpongeBob: Uh, no.
[Cuts to Squidward adjusting his boat outside the kitchen, in the dining area]
Squidward: Idiots, wrecking my boat.
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter the dining area]
Squidward: So, who won your stupid quiz?
Patrick: It was a tie.
Spongebob: Well it wasn’t a tie, but we had lots of fun.
Squidward: [takes the Simple-Ton magazine] Let me see that. [Starts laughing] a triangle?! Patrick didn't know anything about you! [continues laughing] And he's supposed to be your best friend?
Patrick: I know, it's like we're not friends at all!
SpongeBob: Now, now. Patrick may not have passed the quiz, but like a true best friend, he's always here for me. Right, Patrick? [turns to Patrick, but he's nowhere in sight] Patrick?
[Scene shows Patrick outside, buying ice cream from the ice cream truck]
Patrick: Ice cream!
Squidward: Looks like your best friend isn't a friend at all! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [walks outside to Patrick]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! I got you an ice cream. [holds out an ice cream cone to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [takes the cone] Thank you, best friend, Patrick.
Patrick: It's your favorite! Dill Pickle Swirl with mustard and extra bacon bits!
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is your favorite ice cream. My favorite is, plain vanilla.
Patrick: Oh, oh right. [takes the ice cream out of SpongeBob's hand] Well, more ice cream for me!
[SpongeBob's eyes start watering]
Patrick: Oh, can I borrow five bucks?
[SpongeBob miserably takes the money out of his pocket]
SpongeBob: Here! Take your dirty, rotten money! [throws the money onto the ground] Ahhah! I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU ANYMORE! [runs off, crying]
Ice Cream Man: Hey, what's with him?
Patrick: I guess he didn't want any ice cream.
[Cut to SpongeBob in his room, on his bed, sobbing. Gary comes by toward his food bowl, but he sees it's holding SpongeBob's tears as they land right in the bowl]
Gary: Meow-row. [gets splashed by SpongeBob's tears as he sobs even harder. Gary slithers away crossly] Meow-row-row...
SpongeBob: It just isn't fair! [tries to calm himself down] Oh, who needs Patrick anyway? [leaves his house] Rest of my life, here I come! [walks by Patrick, who's sunning himself on his rock]
Patrick: Oh, hey there, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [to himself] Be strong, be strong, be strong, be strong! Good afternoon, Mr. Star. [Walks off]
Patrick: See you later!
[Cuts to Sandy's Treedome, where Sandy is trying to comfort a sobbing SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, Sandy! It was awful! Truly awful! We were like complete strangers!
Sandy: You don't need to know everything about your best friend. That's what keeps the friendship interesting!
SpongeBob: Really?
Sandy: Maybe you and Patrick just need some time apart.
SpongeBob: [sniffles] Yeah! I'll have lots of fun without Patrick! [walks off to Sandy's door, and on his way out, he breaks down in tears again]
Sandy: [To herself] What a crybaby.
[Cuts to SpongeBob walking]
SpongeBob: I don't need Patrick! I can have a good time all by myself! [takes out jellyfishing net] I can go jellyfishing! [sobers up] Patrick and I used to go jellyfishing...I can play leapfrog! [jumps over a rock, then pulls it up on him and tries to toss it over his head, but winds up under it and tries to slide out from under it] I can blow bubbles! [blows a bubble, but it looks just like Patrick,] Uh, maybe not. [bubble pops, SpongeBob sighs]
Patrick: [walking by] Leedle leedle leedle lee!
SpongeBob: Oh, it's Patrick! I can't let him see me! [Drills a hole in the sand and hides in it. Patrick skips over the hole. SpongeBob checks to make sure he's gone, then exits the hole]
Patrick: Leedle leedle lee!
SpongeBob: Well, he doesn't seem to be missing me at all. [Patrick walks off, still singing]
Patrick: Leedle leedle lee!
SpongeBob: Nice that he's gotten over our friendship so quickly! [SpongeBob then returns to the whole, and digs a tunnel that's following Patrick.. Patrick is seen entering the Gym while SpongeBob watches him from afar]
SpongeBob: Patrick works out at the gym? [Takes out binocular and watches Patrick exiting the Gym the Larry the Lobster] And he's hanging out with Larry the Lobster? Maybe I don't know much about Patrick, either.
[cuts to Larry and Patrick entering a cooking supply shop while SpongeBob spies on them]
SpongeBob: [watches Patrick from the inside of a blender] Patrick's shopping for cookery? Very suspicious. Oh! He's coming back! [Hides back in the blender. Patrick comes to the blender and presses a button, activating the blender. Patrick then leaves. SpongeBob hand comes out of the blender and turns it off. And SpongeBob, now liquefied, exits the blender.. Cuts to Larry and Patrick purchasing something from the magic shop. As the exit, one of the top hats from the top hat display follows them]
SpongeBob: [From inside the hat] Hold it right there, Patrick! [jumps out of the hat]
Larry the Lobster: Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick: We were just coming to see you.
SpongeBob: [angrily] Oh, I'll bet you were... to tell me about your new best friend, Larry, I suppose?!
Larry: Whoa, settle down, little dude. I don't want to get in the middle of, whatever this is. [Walks off]
Patrick: Well Larry is a great guy, loads of talent, and good looks.
SpongeBob: I know, he is pretty amazing...
Patrick: He's not my best friend. He was just helping me buy a present.
SpongeBob: [angrily] Who for? Sandy?
Patrick: No. For my REAL best friend, SpongeBob SquarePants. [holds out the bag he's holding]
SpongeBob: Really? [Takes the bag and opens it up] For me? What is it? [Takes out a rubber nose, mustache, and glasses disguise] Oh! I love it! You DO know me, best friend!
Patrick: [wearing the same disguise] I got a pair for me too! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, you're the bestest, best friend Patrick! [puts on his disguise] How do I look?
Patrick: [Screams] How should I know, mysterious stranger?! [runs away, screaming. SpongeBob sighs. And the episode comes to a close]

[The scene cuts to a wide shot of Perch Perkins.]
Perch Perkins: [While walking up to Squidward] Excuse me, sir. [Fred, who is holding a camera, enters the shot.] How do you think you'll do in the race?
[Squidward grabs the microphone.]
Squidward: Hello out there Bikini Bottom! [It cuts to show a medium close up of Squidward. In the upper left corner there is the word "Live" and towards the bottom of the screen is "Bikini Bottom Sleigh Race". All the words are in red.] I'm glad I can finally talk to my adoring fans on television!
[The scene cuts to Fred on his couch, sleeping. He is covered in popcorn and there is a bowl of it below him. The scene returns to Perch Perkins and Squidward. Perch grabs the microphone.]
Perch Perkins: Best of luck to ya. [While walking off-screen] Oh, excuse me miss...
[The scene cuts to a PA speaker.]
Announcer: [Over the PA] On your marks...
[The scene cuts to show the back of the racers. The real Plankton is sneaking away.]
Plankton: So long suckers.
Announcer: ... get set, [The scene shows a very wide shot of the racers.] go!
[Everyone takes off, except Patrick. The scene cuts to a mid-shot of Patrick.]
Patrick: Come on, wormies! Giddy up! [The scene cuts to a wide shot of the Gooey Worms. It then returns to Patrick] Hmm.
[The scene then cuts to a wide shot of the other racers. It then cuts to a time card that reads, "Meanwhile, Back In the Lowlands..."]
French Narrator: Meanwhile, back in the lowlands...
[The scene cuts to a wide shot of the Krusty Krab. It then cuts to a close up of the window, which features a "Gone Racin'" sign on it. Inside, Plankton, jumps into the scene.]
Plankton: Alone at last! [The scene shows a close up of the floor below the window. Plankton jumps down while he chuckles.] Now, there's nothing between me and the secret formula!
[Plankton laughs while walking off-screen. The scene cuts back to the race. It then cuts to Mr. Krabs, right in front of Thaddeus.]
Mr. Krabs: C'mon, boys! Get me to the greenbacks!
[It pans to Plankton and Karen.]
Robot Plankton: I think not old man. Turbo boost, Karen!
[Robot Plankton strikes Karen and laughs. Karen's bottom half is shown. On the rover part, a flap opens and a tail pipe appears. It blasts a large about of fire. It cuts to a wide shot of the racers and Karen and Plankton go flying past the others. It picks up snow, which covers Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs blinks twice.]
Mr. Krabs: [While pushing the snow off himself] No! [He grabs the wheel.] I can't let him win.
Sandy: [As she passes Mr. Krabs in her rocket-shaped sled] Don't worry, he won't. [She pushes a button on a remote.] I will. [Robot worms are shown. It cuts back to Mr. Krabs and Sandy as she passes him.] Yeehaw!
[She passes the other racers.]
Patrick: [As he is running up to SpongeBob, holding his three Gooey Worms] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi Patrick. Where's your sleigh?
Patrick: I dunno.
[Patrick eats the Gooey Worms.]
SpongeBob: Hop in. We'll give you a lift. [Patrick hops in. Gary stops and grumbles. He then strains to continue.] Come on Gary!
[The scene cuts back to the interior of the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: Hehehehe! [hops onto Mr. Krabs' desk and tries to turn safe's handle] Locked?! Ugh. [takes out cutter] Good thing I brought this along. [tries to cut safe, but the cutter slides to the ceiling with Plankton, spins three circles, makes two holes in ceiling, falls off, cuts off Plankton's antennae, and rolls away] I'm gonna need something with more firepower.
[cuts to Sandy]
Sandy: Woo wee! Looks like I lost them! [pushes button, but remote breaks] The remote shorted out! The robots are stuck in high gear! Whoa! [sleigh loses control] Aaaa!
[cuts to Squidward]
Squidward: Those dimwits don't stand a chance against my imported worm. [sleight stops, worm starts to drink tea] Hey! What's the big idea?!
Worm: (speaks in a British Accent) I beg your pardon. It's tea time, anyway. [continues to drink tea]
Squidward: I don't have time for this! [leaves sleigh, and goes by foot] Tea time. Of all the ridiculous concepts!' '[walks onto ice, and slips, the ice cracks, and Squidward falls in, losing his winter clothes, and floats back up in a block of ice, with a shocked face]
[cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick, singing]
Patrick: Whoa! Look at that!
SpongeBob: Squidward! Buddy! [stops] He doesn't look so "hot." We better take him with us.
Patrick: Good idea.
Gary: Meoow... [upset]
[Patrick puts Squidward on the sleigh, SpongeBob strikes Gary. Gary pulls with even more strength, SpongeBob and Patrick continue singing, but stops after a few seconds after hearing moaning]
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you hear that?
[Sandy struggles out of snow pile] [cuts to later, with Sandy also on the sleigh]
SpongeBob & Patrick: Sandy?
Sandy: [shivering] Th-th-th-th-th-thanks, guys.
SpongeBob: No problem, right, Gare?
Gary: [angry] Meow... [continues to pull] Errrgg!
[cuts to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Sniff out the money, little guys! Come on! Marsh! [worms' stomachs growl, and get angry at Mr. Krabs] Wai-wait a minute. I was gonna feed ya! Honest! [worms get angrier]
[cuts back to SpongeBob and others, singing, except Squidward who is still frozen]
Mr. Krabs: [run up to them] Heeelp!
SpongeBob: Hi Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I just been turned into lunchmeat by me own worms! [cuts to furious worms, chasing for him]
SpongeBob: Aaaaa! Hop in, sir! We'll get you out of here!
Mr. Krabs: [quickly rushes into sleigh] Much appreciate it, boy! [sleigh takes off, worms keep chasing]
Everyone except Squidward: Faster! Faster! Faster!
Gary: Mooowww... [tries to go faster]
Everyone: Faster! Faster!
[cuts back and forth between Mr. Krabs' worms and Gary]
Everyone: Faster! [Gary runs in a dead end and stops, tired]
SpongeBob: This is a dead end! [Gary turns around to see the worms entering the dead end]
Everyone: [screaming]
Gary: [like a lion] Rooooooooarr! [after worms run away scared, Gary turns back to normal] Meow. [Everyone stares at Gary for a few seconds, then cheers]
[cheering causes snow at the only road out the dead end collapses and covers the exit]
Mr. Krabs: Great. Now we're trapped.
[cuts to everyone around a fire, made with SpongeBob's hat, but still shivering.
Mr. Krabs: Good thinkin', squirrel! This should keep us alive for at least... a few hours... oh...
Patrick: [shivers] It's-s-s... so c-c-cold!
[SpongeBob's nose with ice on it breaks off, and the ice on Patrick's eyelids shatter off. Gary get so cold he gets into his shell, and apparently he has a warm room with furniture in his shell, he sips his drink. Mr. Krabs' lips shatter off.]
SpongeBob: Hey! How about a campfire song? [Squidward thaws]
Squidward: No Singing!
Everyone: Squidward! [hugs him]
Squidward: [pushes them back] Alright, alright! Someone get me a blanket. [SpongeBob gives him a blanket, Squidward puts it on but still feels cold]
Mr. Krabs: Hey Squidward, what is it with the extra foot, buddy?
Squidward: [looks down] Huh? This isn't mine... [foot lifts up] Waaaahhh! [runs]
[Snow Mollusk breaks through snow]
All: [screaming]
[Snow Mollusk roars]
Mr. Krabs: Not you again!
[Snow Mollusk sticks out five tongues from mouth]
Sandy: Ha! Slimey snow vermin! You missed!
Mr. Krabs: That's weren't the attack.
Sandy: Huh?
[Snow Mollusk pulls back tongues with snow on them]
Mr. Krabs: Hit the deck! [Snow Mollusk starts shooting snowballs out of mouth; Mr. Krabs screams and hides behind a pile of snow, blocking the snowballs, Snow Mollusk aims for Gary]
SpongeBob: Gary! [shields Gary with himself, the snowballs go into SpongeBob's holes, and they come out from the side holes. SpongeBob stands up and runs away with Gary. The Snow Mollusk aims for Squidward]
Squidward: [running and screams; jumps into water] Oh no... not again... [floats up in a block of ice again, but with a disappointed face]
Mr. Krabs: She's reloading! Now's our chance to scram. [everyone sneaks away, Sandy brings the sleigh]
SpongeBob: What is that formidable creature?
Mr. Krabs: That, me boy, is none other than the Abominable Snow Mollusk.
SpongeBob: [shocked]I thought that was just a myth.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I assure you, she's no myth! She's as real as Santy Claus. Twas back when I was young sea captain, [flashback to when Mr. Krabs was a captain] sailing in the Atlantic sea. When the behemith and i first tangled. [Snow Mollusk pops out of sea, young Mr. Krabs gasps, and Snow Mollusk picks up the ship]
SpongeBob: Don't tell me, Mr. Krabs. You peeled back those tentacles with your bare claws! You single-handedly saved your vessel from certain DOOM!
Mr. Krabs: Nope, that didn't work. [flashback continues] She gulped me and me crew down in one swift swallow. [Snow Mollusk swallows all people on ship including Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Oh my! Well, at least you bravely escaped to tell the tale.
Mr. Krabs: Weren't bravery that got us out. Let's just say... We had to wait... for nature, to take its course. [flashback to people in Snow Mollusk's stomach, a bubble floats up and pops, then a flushing sound is heard]
SpongeBob: Hm?[realizing what this really means] Oh! Ew.
Sandy: I'd hate to break up story time, but I'd like to NOT GET EATEN today! [Snow Mollusk's roaring is heard, and everyone gets on sleigh, Snow Mollusk finds them, they leave]
SpongeBob: Gary! Step on it! [Snow Mollusk follows] Oh yeah, Gary, you are really motivated now! Right, guys? [cuts to back of sleigh, and one of the seats are empty with a "Squidward" sign in its place] We forgot Squidward! [sleigh takes a U-turn, and goes between the Snow Mollusk's tentacles] Left, Gary! Left! There he is!
[cuts to Squidward, frozen]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I need a Gooey Worm!
Patrick: Oh, be gentle, it's my last one! [hands SpongeBob a red Gooey Worm]
SpongeBob: Hold on tight! [gives Patrick one end of the Gooey Worm and glides down holding the other one]
Gary: Meow. [as SpongeBob is saving Squidward, the Snow Mollusk finds him]
Patrick: SpongeBob! Come on! [cuts to SpongeBob on Squidward, with Gooey Worm tied on ice block] Let's get outta here! [pulls SpongeBob up, and Snow Mollusk lands on the water. When they are leaving, SpongeBob throws away the Gooey Worm, and falls into Snow Mollusk's mouth when she's getting up, she likes it]
Sandy: Woo, wee! That was a close one, wasn't it, Mr. Krabs? Huh? [in Mr. Krabs' seat, there is a pile of snow with coral as a nose and eyes] Of all the horn swabbles! The banit's trying to weigh us down and make with the prize himself! [throws fake Mr. Krabs out of the sleigh]
[cuts to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Argh argh argh! I'd sooner swallow a jellyfish than share me winnings with y-- [jellyfish flies into Mr. Krabs' mouth and stings him.]
[cuts back to others]
Sandy: We can't let that double crosser beat us to the loot! Full speed ahead and don't stop for nothin', Gary!
Patrick: Hey! [takes rope and stops Gary, making the sleigh fling Sandy out]
Sandy: [in snow] What's the big emergency, Patrick?
Patrick: I saw something shiny.
Sandy: [sarcastic] Oh! Well, let's just drop everything, then!
SpongeBob: Oh, wait, Sandy, I see it too! It looks like... Karen.
SpongeBob: [helps Karen up] Karen?
[Karen's screen shows a spinning hourglass]
Sandy: I say she's in swift need of a reboot! Heee ya! [kicks Karen with her boot, shattering the ice on her]
[Karen's screen shows a picture of a computer wife with words "Computer WIFE [progress bar] Loading..." beside it, and soon starts up.]
SpongeBob: [hears someone saying "you can't stand a chance, Krabs"] Huh? [sees fake Plankton and picks it up] Plankton? [fake Plankton says "don't tell Krabs"] Poor guy, the ice is really getting to him.
Patrick: [grabs fake Plankton] Well we gotta bust him out but quick! I'm gonna sit on him! [puts fake Plankton on a rock, preparing to sit on it]
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! He's very--[Patrick sits on fake Plankton]...fragile. [Patrick gets up, showing bits of metal with wires, a speaker, and an eye, broken, it says "Krabs zzz... stand zzz..."]
Sandy: A similacra!
SpongeBob: [covers Gary's "ears"] Sandy please! Language!
Sandy: Naw, silly! I'm saying, Plankton set up a robotic dummy in his sled!
Karen: That's right. My selfish husband remains in warm, sunny Bikini Bottom, while I freeze my solder off in this bitter tundra. In fact, [cuts to Plankton with fake Plankton and Karen in his lab] this whole race was a plot devised by Plankton. [cuts to Plankton sneaking away before the race] With the entire town distracted, he's free to pursue the Krabby Patty formula undetected.
SpongeBob: Pursue? Formula? We've gotta find Mr. Krabs right now!
Sandy: And exactly how do you propose we find him?
Karen: I saw Mr. Krabs pass by [screen shows Mr. Krabs running] just before my system failed, heading southwest.
SpongeBob: Well, what are we waiting for? [picks Karen, Sandy, Patrick up and throws them into the sleigh, and gets in himself] You heard the lady, Gary, southwest! Mush! Mush!
[cuts to Plankton]
Plankton: [sprays safe with flamethrower] Hehehehe! [touches handle, which is glowing red due to extreme heat] Yeuch! [blows hand] So the safe isn't vulnerable to flame, eh? It seems as though I'll have to get a little more destructive! [accidentally takes out teddy bear, then puts it back] Ahem! I meant destructive! [takes out a stick of dynamite]
[cuts to SpongeBob and others, going up a steep hill]
Gary: [tired] Mooowww, meow meow meow moooww...
SpongeBob: Attaboy, Gary!
[sleigh gets to the tip of the hill, Gary sees a huge ramp below, screeches and gets in the sleigh.]
All: Ahhhh!
[sleigh goes down the ramp, flies into the air, turns a circle, bounces on three hill tops, and back on the road]
SpongeBob & Patrick: Ahh, whew.
Sandy: Cliff! [cliff ahead]
SpongeBob & Patrick: [both scream]
Sandy: Hold on, SpongeBob! [picks up SpongeBob and throws him on another hill's tip, the sleigh goes in a circle with SpongeBob as the turning point, but Squidward, still frozen, flys off in the progress]
SpongeBob: [with bruises on face, missing teeth and extra long legs and arms] We made it! Hooray! Right, Squidward? [cuts to Squidward falling down]
Sandy: Gasp! Oh, my gosh! Patrick! Lean to the other side! [Patrick turns, and the sleigh goes down following Squidward] Excuse me, ma'am.
Karen: What?
[Sandy pulls off Karen's monitor, stands on SpongeBob, and uses the base's pole and sticks it into the block of ice Squidward is in, and pulls him in]
Sandy: Gotcha!
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, have you given any thoughts on how we're gonna--[sleigh crashes to the ground, making everyone flat]...land? [Snow Mollusk spots them]
[cuts to Krusty Krab's safe with sticks of dynamite wrapped around it]
Plankton: [with a shield] Fire in the hole! [dynamite explodes, and safe is completely fine] Rats.
[cuts back to SpongeBob and others]
Sandy: Alright, fellas, I know it's cold. But let's just push forward and keep a lookout for a frozen crab! [closes one eye]
Patrick: [with lots of ice on eyes] I can't feel my looking holes!
SpongeBob: The only thing I can feel is my empty stomach. [stomach implodes]
Sandy: You said it, SpongeBob! I already gnawed through all my provisions. [holds up empty nut bag] I'm getting to the point where I can eat just about anything! [eyes get bloodshot and drools, then thinks SpongeBob is cooked and on a stick] Mmmm... sponge kabob... [shakes head] Hey Patrick, you got any more of them Gooey Worms on you?
Patrick: I wish I did. I lost my last one to the monster and now I'm so hungry! At least, [takes out bag of Jelly Beans] I still have this bag of Jelly Beans to hold me over. [eats a Jelly Bean] Hey! Is this taxi even moving?! [Gary shivering] Come on, Gary! [Gary falls]
SpongeBob: Gasp! Gary! [Gary's slime is frozen] Oh, you poor fella! We put you too hard on you, didn't we? Sorry buddy, I won't make you tow another inch. [puts Gary in sleigh]
Patrick: Great, now we're stuck.
SpongeBob: No, we're not! [pulls ropes, and his arms shatter] Hello, what's this? [cuts to a small anchor] Look! One of Mr. Krabs' sailor tattoos! It must've frozen off his brittle body.
Sandy: We must be heading in the right direction!
[cuts to Krusty Krab]
Plankton: [riding a small plane] [laughing] Secret formula, you are mine! [ejects himself out of plane]
[The plane hits the safe, but the safe is okay]
Plankton: Perhaps I misjudged the skill on that one. [landing] That does it! Listen up safe, I will spill your contents, even if I have to tear you apart. [rips a piece of the safe] Bit by bit. [rips the piece he just rips] Molecule by molecule. [rips a molecule] Atom by atom! [rips an atom, causing it to glow] Uh-oh.
[the atoms explode, obliterating the Krusty Krab and the safe]
Plankton: Surely, the safe couldn't survive nuclear detonation. Come to papa! [takes the bottle containing the secret formula]
[cuts to SpongeBob and his friends] [SpongeBob is still dragging the sleigh, then suddenly hits something]
Patrick: [wakes up] Hey, i'm trying to sleep.
SpongeBob: [realizes that he hits Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
Sandy: He ain't looking so good. We better get him to the sleigh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob?[realizes SpongeBob is frozen] He froze up too. [realizes that the others also frozen. Makes a fire form the sleigh to thaw them out]
Squidward: Aaah. What? You're burning the sleigh!? Are you aware that that was our only mode of transportation?
Sandy: And are you aware I just saved your life?
Mr. Krabs: The race! The million clams! [gasps] I've been trapped in ice, mutinous thieves trying to cheat me out of me winnings. [rattles Squidward]
Karen: Oh cool down there are no winnings, you've been duped!
Mr. Krabs: Duped? You don't mean by...
Karen: Now you're putting it together!
Mr. Krabs: My formula! We've got to get back to Bikini Bottom!
Squidward: We might actually have a chance of getting back if we had a sleigh.
Mr. Krabs: We're doomed. [cries]
SpongeBob: No we're not Mr. Krabs. [turns himself into sleigh] Your chariot awaits!
Mr. Krabs: No offense, but we're not going to catch Plankton moving at a snail's pace.
Sandy: Just leave that to the scientist of the group!
Patrick: Oh geez. Why do I have to do everything?
Sandy: [Sandy creates a modified sleigh. Patrick is spinning from Karen's monitor as Squidward blows his clarinet onto the circuits]
Patrick: Hahahaha!
Sandy: She's all fired up!
SpongeBob: Gary, Mr. Krabs, any hazards on the horizon?
Mr. Krabs: Lookin' clear so far.
SpongeBob: Squidward keep those circuits warm. Patrick hang on!
French Narrator: One frozen wasteland later.
SpongeBob: Hooray! We made it.
Mr. Krabs: Okay... then where's my restaurant?
SpongeBob: Perhaps over there.. [points to smoldering place]
Mr. Krabs: And where's my formula? [runs over to safe]
Sandy: [points to Chum Bucket] Perhaps over there.
Mr. Krabs: The Chum Bucket, now serving... Krabby Patties?! [reading Chum Bucket sign]
SpongeBob: We're too late!
Mr. Krabs: We'll see about that boy-o!
Harold: [Mr. Krabs walks past line] Whoa whoa whoa whoa, you can't cut in line. We've been waiting for a Krabby Patty for three stinking days!
Mr. Krabs: This will only take a minute. [smashes door]
Plankton: Keep your pants on out there! I'll get your Krabby Patty just as soon as I get this bottle open. [tries to open cork from the formula bottle]
Mr. Krabs: Not if I have anything to say and or do about it!
Plankton: Krabs! Why aren't you frozen under the barren tundra?
Mr. Krabs: I guess I didn't want to miss the big unveiling of my sandwich.
Plankton: Well, it would have happened if I could've dislodge this stupid cork!
Patrick: Oh, that's easy! [lifts it out of the bottle.]
All of them: Patrick!
Plankton: Hahaha! I got it now, Krabsy. [beings to run away]
Sandy: That may be true, Plankton, but you've got seven angry customers flanking you on all sides.
Plankton: : Uh... well, I'm sure my loving wife is not a party to this angry mob. You-you've gotta help me here Karen!
Karen: [sarcastically] You've gotta help me... My monitor nearly froze up for good on your little race to oblivion!
Plankton: Babe don't blow an on amp over this, c'mon! [Karen zaps Plankton]
Plankton: Yowza! Ow! That hurt on so many levels... Okay, I give up. You win again, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Then hand over my formula.
Plankton: Okay, Eugene. I'll just sign the surrender treaty first. [He pulls out a pen and clicks it. It turns into a propeller.] Oop! Here I go! Hahahaha! Out smarted you again, aye, fools? [laughs and flies away into a pipe]
Mr. Krabs: You get back here, Plankton!
Squidward: Here we go again...
Plankton: [exits through a vent outside the Chum Bucket, with everyone in close pursuit]
Mr. Krabs: Give up now and I'll let you keep one of your antenna!
Plankton: I'd be delighted to see you try! Ooooooh! You're so close. [Plankton runs up some stair, and hops on top of something. The others follow him.] So long, suckers!
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
Everyone: [gasps when they realize they’re inside a cage]
Plankton: Hehehe!
Mr. Krabs: We're trapped!
Plankton: That's right, Krabs, and if you're thinking of busting out, mind the giant vat of fry grease beneath you.
Mr. Krabs: He's going to turn us into fried snacks!
Patrick: Got any dipping sauce?
Plankton: A little taste of your own medicine aye crab cakes?
Abominable Snow Mollusk: [makes loud noise, and grabs the cage] Nom nom!
SpongeBob: Nom nom?
Abominable Snow Mollusk: Nom nom! [rips the cage open, making everyone in it fall to the ground. She then snatches Patrick] Nom nom!
SpongeBob: W-wait big scary monster. Don't eat Patrick. Eat me, i'm packed with nutrients!
Sandy: No, eat me!
Mr. Krabs: Don't eat me, eat Squidward!
Squidward: Wait, what?!
Abominable Snow Mollusk: [reaches and takes jellybeans from Patrick’s pocket] Nom nom! [hugs Patrick]
SpongeBob: She loves your jellybeans, Patrick!
Plankton: I better go while the going's good.
Abominable Snow Mollusk: [sees Plankton] Jellybean!
Plankton: I can practically taste those Krabby Patties now! [The Abominable Mollusk grabs him with her tongue; Plankton screams as she swallows him and Plankton releases the formula. It lands onto Mr. Krabs' claw and he puts it in his shirt.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happens to Plankton?
Mr. Krabs: He'll just have to wait for nature to take its course. [laughs]
Plankton: [The Abominable Snow mollusk belches and inside her stomach shows Plankton sitting on a jellybean.] Well, I suppose dear old dad was right. I should have minored in business administration. [a flushing noise is then heard in the background, concluding the episode]
[SpongeBob and Patrick are coming out of their houses.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: You ready for some fun, old pal?
Patrick: I sure am, old buddy!
SpongeBob: Hey, here comes fun now! [Notices a fish driving down the street]
SpongeBob & Patrick: [takes a deep breath] AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! [Continues screaming, and then starts flopping on the ground, while still screaming. Then they both laugh]
SpongeBob: Wow! Doesn't get any better than that!
Patrick: Yeah! I love boat screaming! Oh! Oh! Hey! Hey! Here comes another one!
[Notices another boat with Pilar and Shelly driving down the street]
SpongeBob & Patrick: AHHHHHHHHH! [The boat passes by them]
SpongeBob: Here comes another one! [Notices Nat driving down the street]
Patrick: AHHHHHHHHHH! [He and SpongeBob scream as Harold drives on by as well. Then they notice Frank driving a really small car]
SpongeBob & Patrick: Ahhhhh... [Notice Archie driving a scooter and their faces get smaller] ahh... [Notice Plankton on a unicycle] ah...
Plankton: Morons!
SpongeBob & Patrick: [Notices Nazz] Heeeee... [Their heads explode] AHHHHHHHHHHHHH! [Notices Larry the Lobster driving down the street and they continue screaming as Patrick smashes SpongeBob around. They notice a bus and they both scream through megaphones, until Squidward appears]
Squidward: [From his window] Would you two mind stopping with your baby games!? Didn't anybody tell you it's the break of dawn!?
SpongeBob: Oh, good morning, Squidward! Yeah, Patrick here told me.
Squidward: When are you two gonna grow up?
Patrick: How do you play that?
SpongeBob: Oh!? Maybe Squidward can come down and teach us how to play it! That will be real fun, won't it, Patrick? [Notices Patrick has fallen asleep. He scratches himself with his leg while he is sleeping. Then SpongeBob notices another boat] AHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhh... [Falls down] It’s just not the same without Patrick playing along, too. [Taps Patrick who still is sleeping] Alright, Patrick, you leave me no choice. [Pinches Patrick and he wakes up]
Patrick: Ow! [Turns around with something fuzzy on his face] What's the big idea!?
SpongeBob: Patrick! You have a beard!
Patrick: I do? [Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick walking]
SpongeBob: You sure look grown-up with that new beard!
Patrick: Wow! You really think so? [Squidward appears behind him]
Squidward: And everybody knows that grown-ups never play with kids! And on that note, I would like to personally commend the sea star for taking his first baby steps into the adult world! Facial hair is a good start I suppose.
Patrick: I am curious to know what mature people, like Squidward, do. Won't you show me?
Squidward: Show you?
Patrick: Show me! Show me! Oh, please, please, please! Pretty please! Pretty please!
Squidward: [Sighs] I know I'm going to regret this... Alright! I will take on this mission!
Patrick: Hooray!
Squidward: In the hopes that a quiet, grown-up neighborhood will prevail at last. Moving me one step closer to peace and blissy tranquility. A place where I can-
SpongeBob: Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Squidward: What?!
SpongeBob: May I tag along and observe your instruction?
Squidward: Why in a million years will I let you tag along?
SpongeBob: Because some of your instructions in maturity will rub off on me! Bringing us TWO steps closer to a quiet, grown-up neighborhood!
Squidward: Wow, that actually makes sense. It must be working already!
SpongeBob: Is that a yes?
Squidward: [Mumbles] Okay.
[Cuts to Squidward's house]
Squidward: Let me escort you to my place my good sir! We need to start with personal grooming for your grown-up makeover!
Patrick: [Stretches pants] Sounds good to me!
Squidward: We may have to find you clothes as well.
Patrick: New clothes?
Squidward: To go along with your new beard which makes you look very distinguished!
Patrick: Distinguished?
SpongeBob: [Holds up hand] Alright! Distinguished!
Patrick: [Also holds up hand] Yeah!
Squidward: [Grabs their hands] Excuse me! Grown-ups do not high-five!
Patrick: Oh, right!
[Squidward and Patrick enter Squidward's house leaving SpongeBob outside]
SpongeBob: [Laughs] We do do da do do de! [Enters Squidward's house]
[Squidward is measuring Patrick's weight size and ties a red ribbon around his neck in a bow, Patrick does the same with a green ribbon and ties it in a bow on his head. SpongeBob is behind Patrick wearing "fancy" clothes]
SpongeBob: So um, what do you guys think? Sweet duds, huh, Patrick?
Patrick: Heh heh, sure are!
Squidward: Ahem!
Patrick: For a baby!
Squidward: Well played, Patrick! Well played... [He and Patrick walk off]
[Cuts to the Bikini Bottom Men's Club with Patrick and Squidward walking up to Thaddeus]
Thaddeus: May I take your hat and cane sir?
Patrick: Why certainly. [Gives him his hat and cane]
Thaddeus: Enjoy your evening, gentlemen.
SpongeBob: [Slides in and starts humming a tune and dancing then enters the Men's Club. Squidward mumbles something]
[Cuts to Squidward and Patrick sitting down being served]
Waiter: Appetizers. [Holds up a plate showing some food]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Eats! [Jumps up and sits on the floor] Yum! Yum! Yum!
Waiter: And we also have... [Holds up another plate showing milk and cookies] ...milk and cookies. [Gives it to SpongeBob, who then starts to eat it]
Patrick: Oh! Are those chocolate chip cookies? Can I have-
Squidward: Patrick! I'm sure you'd rather have some tetrazzini we grown-ups ordered, right?
Patrick: Duh, yeah, Squidward. I'm frankly shocked they serve such elementary fare here.
Squidward: Indeed...
[Cuts to the Art Museum]
Squidward: And my personal favorite piece is [Shows them a statue of a fish on a man's body] this lovely statue from the Reef-aissance Era-
Patrick: Boring!
Squidward: Boring!?
Patrick: Oh, ah, no. I said “flooring”! The flooring compliments the artwork here exquisitely!
Squidward: Yeah... yes, I suppose it does... [Notices SpongeBob on the shield of the statue laughing] SpongeBob! You get down from there right now!
SpongeBob: [Takes a picture and falls off] DOH! [Lands on a picture leaving his imprint on it] Don't worry, you guys! I'm okay! Really! I'm okay! [Notices paint on his hand then on his back then looks at the ruined painting. Backs up to the painting and touches it with his back] There! Good as ne- ah! [Tries to wipe it off, but only makes it worse. He then lifts up the wall and hides the painting under there. He then draws a picture on paper and puts it on the empty space]All fixed, you guys! [The picture falls off]
Patrick: Security! [Two bouncers take SpongeBob out of the Museum]
SpongeBob: Please be gentle! [The Bouncers leave] Heh, that's weird [One of the bouncers comes back]I thought I was gonna get tossed out on my... [Gets kicked by the bouncer] AHHHHHHHHH! [Lands on the ground and notices Squidward and Patrick walking along]
Squidward: Patrick Star, I am very proud of you for what you did in there! You know that beard is the best thing that has ever happened to you! Well, other than me of course. Heh...
SpongeBob: Beard... I must remove that beard! [Takes out a razor] Remove beard! Restore friendship! [Takes off after them]
Squidward: And that's what I told them look I wanted to... [Notices SpongeBob tackle down Patrick]
SpongeBob: [On top of Patrick gripping his beard]That's it! It must be done!
Squidward: [Grabs SpongeBob's arm] SpongeBob! The only thing that must be done is cutting the cord with you!
SpongeBob: No, please!
Squidward: Look, Mr. BabyPants, [Drops SpongeBob] ...it's gladly clear you learned nothing today on how to be mature!
SpongeBob: But-
Squidward: No buts! We are through entertaining your company! Shall we?
Patrick: Let's shall! [They both leave]
SpongeBob: [Teary-eyed] Patrick, don't leave me! [Falls backwards]
Patrick: [Panting and sweating as he and Squidward go up stairs] Why are they so many stairs!?
Squidward: You only gone up three stairs! [Camera zooms out showing they only walked a few steps]
Patrick: It feels like four.
Squidward: We are about to enter the pinnacle of grown-up culture here in Bikini Bottom! Also known as: The Famed Bikini Bottom Opera House! [The Opera House is show and Squidward has his arms out looking at Patrick]
Patrick: What?
Squidward: Nothing, let's find our seats. [Inside the Opera House on the higher stands]
Patrick: Hey, alright! Box seats! Uh, I mean: This seat choice is most mature! Certainly more so than that rapscallion Sponge whose name we shall not mention would've picked!
Squidward: Certainly
[The curtain opens with a male opera singer opening the show]
Patrick: A most exemplary performance!
Squidward: Oh! Oh! It gets even more thrilling from here!
[The curtain rises and this time SpongeBob appears in female opera clothes]
Squidward: What the?!
Patrick: She's beautiful!
SpongeBob: [Takes out a note and reads it] There's once, was a man, from Nantucket. [The crowd gasps] Sorry, wrong one! AHEM! Dear friend, don't say that is over! As long as I breathe, I will cherish our bond!♪
Squidward: Terrible!
SpongeBob: Dear friend, don't say that it is all over! My heart bounces on rocks, jagged and gray! Dear friend, don't that it is all over! Let's stay pals! What do! You say?♪
Patrick: [Starts crying and his "beard" starts to move]
Sea Urchin: Hey! How's a sea urchin is suppose to get any sleep with all of these salty tears falling on him!? I gotta get out of you! [Gets off of Patrick's face and jumps away going through the crowd] Excuse me! Coming through! Eh, watch it, mister! [In front of SpongeBob] Say, lady? How do I get outta this joint!?
SpongeBob: Exit stage left is that away!
Sea Urchin: Thanks, cutie! Nice hat! [Leaves]
Patrick: Hey! Stop that beard!
SpongeBob: Patrick! It's not a beard! It's a sea urchin! It must've been sleeping on your face until your tears woke it from its hibernation.
Patrick: How do you know my name!?
SpongeBob: Because, Mr. Patrick Star,... [Takes off hat] ...you told me.
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Hugs him]
Patrick: Oh, please! You can call me Patrick!
[The crowd cheers for SpongeBob and Patrick until they are interrupted by Squidward]
Squidward: Quiet! Hold it! Stop it right there! I am ashamed and disgusted by you people! I mean, don't you know what terrible performance when you see it!?
Fish: Yes! We do!
Squidward: That's what I thought you- [Gets hit in the face by a tomato] No! No! No! I didn't mean it like that! It was- [Gets hit by many fruit and vegetables]
SpongeBob & Patrick: [Laughing] Food fight!
[The episode ends with SpongeBob, Patrick, and the crowd throwing food]
[Transitions outside where a magnet is dragged on the ground. Camera zooms out to reveal Mr. Krabs wearing a safari cap]
Mr. Krabs: What better way to spend an afternoon than trolling the sea vent for spare change. [Then something tugs on Mr. Krabs' magnet] Whooh! [Mr. Krabs pulls and a giant pile of sand hangs from his magnet] There's got to be a small fortune than discarded paperclips in there! [The sand falls, only to reveal a second magnet. He then gets upset] I knew this place looked familiar. [Startles in surprise] What's this? Goodness, that must be Sandy's treedome dwelling, and inside looks to be the largest soybean I have ever layed me eyestocks on. Now this bears getting a closer look. [He rings the door bell on Sandy's treedome and Sandy opens it in her air suit] Good afternoon, Miss Sandy.
Sandy: And good afternoon to you Mr. Krabs. What brings you out to this fine neck of the woods?
Mr. Krabs: Well uh, I just happen to be in the neighborhood and was wondering if you could see you in clear and grace me with a comprehensive tour of your homesweet treedome. [chuckles] I hear the giant soybean is lovely this time of the year.
Sandy: Sure, lets get you fitted with a helmet.
Mr. Krabs: Don't bother yourself. As long as I keep me ole lungs moist, I can breath your fancy air all day long.
Sandy: Come on in then. [they go inside the treedome]
[Scene cuts to the interior of the treedome]
Mr. Krabs: Seems so much bigger once your inside.
Sandy: That's what they all say. Did I already show you my single wheeled roller skate or my helicopter that is powered by coconut milk?
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Oh yeah, that sounds interesting Sandy, but uh actually...
Sandy: [walks over to her table and holds up a device that looks like a cube puzzle] Or my artificial intelligence that comes in the form of a multi-colored cubeshaped puzzle. See it can solve itself. [Zooms in to reveal that the Cube puzzle matches with the shapes on it]
Mr. Krabs: Uh Sandy, actually I'm not interested in all of that.
Sandy: Okay, well was there something particular you wanted to see?
Mr. Krabs: Tell me about your giant soybean.
[Scene cuts to Sandy and Mr. Krabs with the giant soybean plant]
Sandy: This is the result of an experimental growth serum I develop. It could easily feed a lot of hungry people.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Or a supply of entire rest---. [Counting on his calculator and mumbling to himself]
Sandy: Once the testing is complete, the growth serum could be used to do a lot of good things.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps]
Sandy: Sure would hate to see it fallen into the wrong hands. Someone who might just use it to try and get-
Mr. Krabs: Rich! I'll be rich!
Sandy: What's that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, could I borrow your telephone? [dials the telephone and it starts ringing] Heh, it's ringing.
SpongeBob: [suddenly runs into the scene] Mr. Krabs, I came as soon as I got the call!
Mr. Krabs: [puts the phone back in] Uh, did you bring a Krabby Patty like I was planning to ask you to do?
SpongeBob: [brings out a Krabby Patty] Aye aye, captain.
Mr. Krabs: Perfect! Okay Sandy, administer the growth serum.
Sandy: I don't know, Mr. Krabs. I can't predict what's going to happen.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you did say it needs further testing. Test it on the Krabby Patty.
Sandy: Well, I suppose so. But only a single drop.
Mr. Krabs: Fair enough. [Sandy puts a drop of growth serum onto the Krabby Patty] Is it suppose to smell like that?
Sandy: If you two will excuse me, I need to pay a quick visit to a little squirrel's room. [hands Mr. Krabs the growth serum before leaving the scene] Would you mind holding these while I'm gone? I'll only be a minute.
Mr. Krabs: [looks at the growth serum] Oh no, we don't mind. [dumps the whole beaker onto the Krabby Patty] Heh heh heh, there.
SpongeBob: But Sandy said-
Mr. Krabs: [closes SpongeBob's mouth] Sh sh sh sh sh sh sh. [He and SpongeBob goes to Sandy's door] Thanks for the tour, Sandy, see you later! [leaving Sandy's treedome and the camera zooms in on the empty growth serum beaker]
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walking]
Mr. Krabs: Eh, that patty didn't look like it's growing to me. Pfft, growth serum. Waste of a perfectly Krabby Patty.
[Krabby Patty suddenly grows on SpongeBob's hands]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Great, let's get into the Krusty Krab.
[Krabby Patty grows even bigger. SpongeBob struggles to carry it]
SpongeBob: Patty... becoming... awkward...
Mr. Krabs: Oh, here, here. [Brings out a grocery bag] Put it in this grocery bag.
SpongeBob: Grocery bag? Where'd you get a grocery bag?
Mr. Krabs: The grocery store.
[Scene cuts to the inside of the Krusty Krab. Squidward is at his post. SpongeBob comes by carrying the big Krabby Patty, trying to keep it balanced. Squidward stares at SpongeBob as he goes to the kitchen. The patty is now on the table. Mr. Krabs comes in as the Krabby Patty grows even bigger. The patty appears to be pulsing.]
SpongeBob: So, uh, how big's this thing suppose to get?
Mr. Krabs: Heh heh, who cares. It's an endless supply of free patties! And cook them fast, boy! [walks out the door] We got customers!
Squidward: [comes in from his post with an order] SpongeBob! Are you going to cook that thing or just stand there staring at it? [throws the order]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward. Coming right up! [runs to the stove while grabbing the order] Order up, Squidward! [carrying a plate of piled up Krabby Patties]
Squidward: All right, keep them coming! [grabs the Krabby Patties]
SpongeBob: You betcha! [takes a scrap of patties from the big patty and puts them on the stove. SpongeBob flips one of them as the big Krabby Patty grows even bigger behind SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh my goodness! I almost forgot to flip that one. [points to a Krabby Patty and flips it] There we go. [brings out another pile of Krabby Patties and the giant Krabby Patty bumps Squidward's head.]
Squidward: Ok, that's great SpongeBob, but you don't have to knock me in the-  BAGEGAH! [sees at the Krabby patty growing behind SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Squidward, why did you make that weird noi- [he looks at the Patty and screams as it comes alive] Ahh! Easy boy. Easy. Never thought I'd say this but, I've gotta get out of this kitchen! [SpongeBob runs to the exit, but sees the grill eaten up] Nooooooo! Huh? [SpongeBob stares down as the Krabby Patty advances to his shoe. SpongeBob fights it off with his spatuala, but that gets eaten. SpongeBob screams then desperately yanks off his left shoe and sock, while the patty eats that up.] Squidward! That giant Krabby Patty is on a rampage! We have to escape!
Squidward: [sees SpongeBob's bare foot] Do you always go barefoot at work, or have I just never noticed before?
SpongeBob: [pointing to his bare foot] Wouldn't this just count as half-barefoot? Squidward, behind you! [SpongeBob points to the growing patty, now destroying the Krusty Krab] Abandon ship! [Squidward screams as he and SpongeBob both flee]
Fish:: [everyone runs out of the Krusty Krab] It's a Krabalanche! [SpongeBob and Squidward try to exit, but Mr. Krabs blocks their way.]
Mr. Krabs: Hold it! And just what is it you two think you're doing?
Squidward: The restaurant's being invaded by a 300 foot uncooked menu item. We're getting outta here!
Mr. Krabs: Whoa ho, this is a dream come true! You can't just leave!
Squidward: Oh, do you have a better idea?
Mr. Krabs: Stay?... And work?
Squidward: Okay, you go right ahead. But I'd rather stay alive than stay at work. That means you- [Squidward turns to see the cash register getting eaten by the Krabby Patty]
Mr. Krabs: Cashy! [Mr. Krabs runs over to the register]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, look out!
Mr. Krabs: Aaah! [Mr. Krabs is eaten by the Krabby Patty, which then proceeds to eat a table, a barrel chair, and a column]
Squidward: [To SpongeBob] I think it's our break time, don't you? [SpongeBob and Squidward run out of the Krusty Krab, screaming. The patty eats the Krusty Krab whole and chases them.]
Plankton: [watching the scene from the rooftop of the Chum Bucket with a telescope] What's this? [puts down the telescope] Krabs is cooking up some new scheme to undermine the success of his biggest competitor? ME?! [folds the telescope] Ah, I'd better get a closer look. [exits the Chum Bucket] [SpongeBob and Squidward are still running] Out of my way, you fools!
SpongeBob: [skids to a stop, while Squidward keeps running] Plankton, you're going the wrong way! Turn back or be crushed by a giant monster!
Plankton: [keeps running] I can't hear you! I need to see this! [Plankton skids and falls backwards] Holy mother of all creatures great and small! [The patty gets closer] It's the largest Krabby Patty the world has ever seen! It's... it's... gorgeous... [Plankton runs over to the patty] Oh, great patty! Take me! Take me home, daddy! [jumps into the patty]
Dale: [The Bikini Bottom citizens see the patty and start running away] Keep running, it's getting closer!
Fish: No, it isn't! Look! Where I'm pointing! It stopped!
Dale: [They stop running and look] Hey! He's right! [The giant patty is actually stopping for a stoplight. It turns green and the patty starts moving again. The fish run away]
[Police officer tickets a car, only for it to be swallowed by the giant patty]
[The giant patty then proceeds to eat the entire town]
Lady in Teal: Snookums! Look out! [pulls the pet worm away from the patty] You've got to promise mommy you'll be more careful! Neptune knows what he'd do if you were swallowed by the putrid ooze that's running rapid in our streets. [gets swallowed by Krabby Patty]
[Scene changes to SpongeBob seeing Gary sleeping at SpongeBob's home]
SpongeBob: Gary! Gary wake up! Pack up your stuff! Our house is about to be knocked over by a giant Krabby Patty!
[Gary yawns and goes back to sleep]
[SpongeBob takes Gary and runs screaming out of his house, which then gets eaten by the giant krabby patty; SpongeBob runs to Patrick's house and opens the rock]
SpongeBob: Wake up Patrick! We gotta get out of here!
Patrick: Huh...oh hi, SpongeBob. I just had the strangest dream, I was being chased by a giant Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: That wasn't a dream!
[The two run screaming away from the rock, which ends up being swallowed by the Giant Krabby Patty]
Patrick: SpongeBob! What do we do?
SpongeBob: We'll find Sandy, she'll know what to do!
[They run to Sandy's house which is broken with the dome shattered to bits]
Patrick: I don't think she's home, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: She has to be, this is her treedome! Sandy, where are you?
Sandy: SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob opens up a toilet next to him, thinking Sandy is in it.]
SpongeBob: Sandy?
Sandy: No, SpongeBob! Up here! [waves to SpongeBob from helicopter] And hurry! I'm running out of coconut milk!
[Cues to SpongeBob, Patrick, Gary, and Sandy in the helicopter]
SpongeBob: Wow, what happened to your treedome?
Sandy: Well, that giant soybean got too big, so I chopped it up into a giant salad. Anyone got any giant croutons?
Patrick: ...I think I'm gonna be sick.
SpongeBob: What's wrong, Patrick? Airsickness?
Patrick: No...the thought of a salad that size is more than I can handle.
Sandy: And now that I've mastered the soy bean, I can master that patty.
SpongeBob: Really? How?
Sandy: The puzzle cube told me. The key to defeating the patty is you, SpongeBob! All I have to do is get you closer to the patty so that you can make direct contact.
SpongeBob: Direct contact!? Are you sure?
Sandy: The puzzle cube never lies.
[The Giant Krabby Patty is now in sight]
Sandy: Alright, we have visual. Putting you into position, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob climbs down via a ladder]
SpongeBob: Okay, bye. [Ladder is hoisted back up]
SpongeBob: Well giant patty, I guess it's just you and me. Wait, what was I supposed to do again?
Sandy: Just make direct contact!
SpongeBob: Direct contact, you mean like this? 
[SpongeBob touches the giant patty with his finger. He then absorbs it]
Sandy: It's working! Keep going! You can do it!
SpongeBob: Body filling with Krabby Patty. Enormous strain.
[Krabby Patty spits out buildings]
SpongeBob: Never absorbed this much Krabby Patty into my body before! In fact, I've never absorbed any Krabby Patties into my body, come to think of it!
[He entirely absorbs it. The buildings and people in Bikini Bottom are freed. SpongeBob is now huge and Krabby Patty colored]
SpongeBob: Ok...what do I do now?
[Scene changes to Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is on a box announcing the new Pre-Absorbed Patties via SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Step right up folks! For a limited time, free absorbed Krabby Patties!
[Squidward opens the cash register; he proceeds to talk into a walkie-talkie]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Two! Medium-rare!
SpongeBob: [also talking into walkie-talkie] Copy that. Over.
[SpongeBob, still in Krabby Patty form, proceeds to make the Krabby Patties with drips of Krabby Patties from his finger]
Mr. Krabs: That's it! Don't crowd! While supplies last, don't be shy! Come on!
[Two Krabby Patty meats drop to the grill]
[SpongeBob laughs, the screen fades out, and the episode ends]
[SpongeBob is reading a book in his library with Gary sitting next to him. A roller coaster crashes through the wall and hits a statue's head, causing it to hit the bookcase and the books collapse]
SpongeBob: Ah! Guests! Could I offer you some lemonade?
Frankie Billy: Man! That has got to be the worst amusement park I have ever been to! I mean, we're lucky to escape with our lives!
Harold: I agree! The world would be a much better place when Glove World! is closed down for good! [Everyone claps]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, did you just say Glove World!?
Frankie Billy: Yeah. Glove World!. They're gonna close it. Tomorrow! Forever!
SpongeBob: Close Glove World!? Has the world gone mad?!
Frankie Billy: Well, it depends on your definition.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, I gotta go. [SpongeBob leaves in the library]
Frankie Billy: Wh-wh-wh what about our lemonade? [Cut to Patrick's rock, SpongeBob was running and stops to knock on the rock]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick was in the shower inside the rock]
Patrick: I can't come out now SpongeBob. I'm taking a shower.
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, it's Glove World! They're gonna... [Patrick is out of the shower and running]
Patrick: Glove World!? [SpongeBob starts running]
SpongeBob: Patrick, wait! [Cutscene to Glove World! Entrance. SpongeBob and Patrick made it to Glove World!]
SpongeBob: There it is, Patrick. Glove World!.
Patrick: Look at that guy, he must be the owner.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh, come on. Excuse us, sir, we heard a horrible rumor that you're gonna close Glove World! forever.
Patrick: Close Glove World!?! Has the world gone mad?! [Patrick is not wearing shorts and the owner is horrified.]
Glove World! Owner: Here, son, take this. You don't wanna get cold. [Patrick is putting on his Glove World! hat as pants]
Patrick: Uh, it feels good.
SpongeBob: Ooh, that looks Glovey on you, Patrick.
Patrick: It fits like a glove.
SpongeBob: Glove size fits all.
Patrick: A penny saved is a penny gloved!
SpongeBob: You can leave a glove to glove, but you can't make it glove.
Patrick: She gloves me, she gloves me not.
SpongeBob: All's fair in glove and war.
Patrick: Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove.
Glove World! Owner: Well, enjoy the hat. Now if you folks will excuse me, I have a rickety old theme park to close down.
SpongeBob: Then the rumors are true, you are gonna close Glove World!.
Glove World! Owner: Yep. [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Nooooo!
Glove World! Owner: I understand you're concern, but really... [SpongeBob and Patrick screams again]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Nooooo! [Zooms out through Glove World!]
SpongeBob: Oh, please, Mr. Soon To Be Ex-owner of Glove World!. Could you see in your heart, to let us ride all our favorite rides? Just one last time.
Patrick: For all time's ride sake.
Glove World! Owner: Well, seeing it's our last day of operation anyway, and as long as the two of you pay the full admission price, sure, go right ahead!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [SpongeBob & Patrick are kissing to his feet.. Cut to Tilt-A-Hurl]
SpongeBob: Well, there she is, Patrick. It's time to say goodbye to the Tilt-A-Hurl. [SpongeBob and Patrick are getting in the seats]
Patrick: Goodbye, Tilt-A-Hurl. [The metal seat bar hits SpongeBob and Patrick. The Tilt-A-Hurl is starting to spin]
SpongeBob & Patrick: Ow! [Hurls Again] Ow! [Hurls Again] Ow! [Hurls Again] Ow! [Hurls one more time] Ow! [The Tilt-A-Hurl has stopped]
Patrick: We'll miss you. [SpongeBob and Patrick are getting out of seats.. Next, they are at the Glove Drop]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, Glove Drop.
Patrick: So many fun memories on this ride.
SpongeBob: I know, Patrick, but we have to be brave. [Everyone is on the Glove Drop. The hand pushes the Glove Drop. It's falling down. Everybody is screaming, except SpongeBob and Patrick are crying. It crashes to the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick are up.. sniffles] Where to next, Patrick?
Patrick: I think you know where, pal. [After that, they are looking the Glove Boat]
SpongeBob: The Glove Boat. My most favorite ride in entire glove kingdom. It's the last time i'm ever gonna ride it.
Patrick: Come on, buddy. Let's take our seats. [Everyone is on the glove boat]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [weakly] Wee. [The glove boat is swinging back and forth, until it's upside down. And everyone is falling down.. Cut through the Glove World!]
SpongeBob: I just don't get it, I mean, why? Why must Glove World! close? [The roller coaster fall on the ground]
Patrick: Beats me. Let's go ride the Ferris Wheel. [Cut to the Ferris Wheel. SpongeBob sighs. The Ferris Wheel is rolling]
SpongeBob: Ew, did you hear that?
Patrick: Excuse me.
SpongeBob: No, not that it was... oh no, Patrick, look!
Patrick: Oh no! What am I looking at?
SpongeBob: The Ferris Wheel. It ripped free of it mornings! [The Ferris Wheel is still rolling]
Patrick: Then you mean...
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Patrick: It somehow ripped free of it mornings! [Everyone is screaming. And the Ferris Wheel is still rolling] SpongeBob, what are you doing? We must remain seated at all times!
SpongeBob: We have to jump off this thing before it crashes! Come on! [SpongeBob jumps off the Ferris Wheel]
Patrick: Bu-bu-bu-bu? But you know I'm allergic to jumping! You know that! [SpongeBob on the ground and then he runs]
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's now or never! You can do this!
Patrick: I uh, oh, if you say so. [Patrick tries to jump. Patrick was out of the ferris wheel]
SpongeBob: Nice job, Patrick.
Patrick: Thanks!
SpongeBob: Look! [The Ferris Wheel crashed in the Glove Lake] Whoa, right in the middle of Glove Lake.
Patrick: That's really gonna spoil the view for the residents of Glove Castle.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think the time has come for us to accept reality.
Patrick: We've come this far why start now?
SpongeBob: All I'm saying is maybe there's a reason Glove World! is closing. I mean just look around you, open your eyes.
Patrick: Okay. [Patrick literally does so. At the Hall of Mirrors, Tom and his son are laughing at the mirror, but the mirrors are shattered. Next at the mud slide, the log has falls into the mud. Thaddeus got worms on his body, including Evelyn. At the glove karts, Harold was honking the wheel]
Harold (red fish): Move it, slowpoke!
Fred: Hey, who you calling slowpoke, you sardine! [Everyone is stuck in the glove karts. Patrick closed his eyes]
SpongeBob: See what I mean, Patrick? Glove world! is on its last legs.
Patrick: Yeah, or on its last finger.
SpongeBob: I just wish there was something we can do. [Patrick smiles]
Patrick: I know what we can do. Let's take a trip to Glove World! to cheers ourselves up.
SpongeBob: Wait a second. [gasps] That's it!
Patrick: It is?
SpongeBob: Of course, we just have to fix Glove World!.
Patrick: We do?
SpongeBob: Then everybody will love it again, and then will have no choice but to keep Glove World! open. Are you with me?
Patrick: I think so. Yeah, I'm here. [Cut to the hall of mirrors, and SpongeBob is in the mirror]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this is it you remember what to say?
Patrick: SpongeBob, I'm not a stupid. Come one, come all, to the new, the improved...
SpongeBob: [whispery] Hall of mirrors.
Patrick: Hall of Mirrors!
Nat: Wow, new approved. [SpongeBob turns into Nat] Wow, that's fantastic!
SpongeBob: It's working.
Ugly Fish: Oh, I'll try it. [SpongeBob turns into Ugly Fish] Hey! What kind of mirror is this!? [Ugly fish hits SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ow!
Ugly Fish: I'm glad they're closing this place down! [Cut the Bubble Poppin' Boy and Monroe]
Bubble Poppin' Boy: Hey there, kid. [Monroe kicks his leg] Ow! You little brat! I have had it! Three and a half weeks of working here and this is how I'm treated!? You're gonna have to pay for my shin-replacement surgery!
Glove World! Owner: I'm sorry you're feel that way, but if we were to accommodate every employee- [Bubble Poppin' Boy takes off the glove mascot and throws it at the owner]
Bubble Poppin' boy: Accommodate this, boss man! [walks away]
Glove World! Owner: Great! Now where am I gonna find another mascot?
Patrick: Mr. Owner, Mr. Owner! Can I wear the Glovey Glove costume? Please, please? I've always wanted to try it on. And also this hat you let me earlier is turning to get little worn out. See? [Close up to Patrick's butt]
Glove World! Owner: Well, sure, why not? I mean, what could go wrong?
Patrick: Thanks! [Patrick laughs. Cut to Ice cream]
Ice cream employee: Here you go, little boy.
Monroe: Thanks! [Patrick appears]
Patrick: Oh, oh! Glove ice cream! [Monroe cries] Thanks! [In the Glove Karts, Patrick cuts in line]
Sandals: The park mascot, cutting in line? [Monroe appears being angry]
Monroe: And he stole my ice cream! [Patrick has Monroe's ice cream on his mouth, and spits all over]
Patrick: I thought he gave it to me. [SpongeBob looks the glove swing is stopping]
SpongeBob: Boy, the swing ride is really slowing down. That's something I can fix. [The guy is sleeping. And SpongeBob appears]
SpongeBob: Excuse me. [The guy fell. And SpongeBob gets the glove hat, and puts it on his head. He pulls the lever to the fastest setting. And the glove swing is fastest. And everyone is screaming. Billy's hat has been flew away. Lloyd's shirt has flew away. Mabel's hair is flew away. All of them has flew away from the bottom] Much better. [The roller coaster flew off the track. Everyone is screaming. All of them were flown away. SpongeBob runs through the glove pole] Ooh. [SpongeBob is pushing the glove pole.] There. [The gray fish is landed safely]
Gray Fish: Huh? Hey, I landed safely! [All of them are landed safely]
All: Hey, we landed safely! [The glove pole then snaps and all of them fall on the ground. SpongeBob steps back. Patrick is chasing with a mallet. And everyone is screaming]
Fish: He's insane! Run for your lives! [Everyone is exiting Glove World!]
Patrick: Come back here!
SpongeBob: Patrick, Stop! What are you doing?
Patrick: I'm just trying to test their strength with this giant hammer.
SpongeBob: Listen, Patrick, did you hear that?
Patrick: Yeah, it's the sound of total silence. [The tumbleweed appears and across through the Glove World!] Plus tumbleweeds.
SpongeBob: Everybody's gone home, Patrick. We couldn't fix Glove World!, and now it's over. They're gonna close it, there's nothing we can do.
Patrick: Well, there is one thing we can do. [At night, SpongeBob and Patrick are chained up at the Glove World! entrance. And the glove owner comes]
Glove World! Owner: What are you doing?
SpongeBob: We're doing what any concern responsible person does when they're left no other choice.
Patrick: Yeah, brother! We're chaining ourselves, to a a gate.
Glove World! Owner: Well, I hope you don't plan on staying chained for long. Or you'll miss the big grand opening tonight.
SpongeBob and Patrick: The grand What?
Glove World! Owner: The grand opening. The only reason we're closing down Glove World!, it's because Glove Universe is opening tonight. See for yourself. [The Glove Universe is grand opening with fireworks.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Glove Universe?!
Glove World! Owner: Isn't she something? [sighs] Well, you two have a good night.
SpongeBob: Glove Universe grand opening! Are you ready, Patrick?!
Patrick: [Excited]You bet!
SpongeBob: Okay, let's get out of the chains. Give me the key.
Patrick: [Cluelessly]What key?

Squidward: Ah-he-he-hem. [Plays jazzy tune]
SpongeBob: Kind of sounds like Squidward's practicing his clarinet over there. Doesn't it, Gary? Gary? Well, I can't just stand by and let him practice alone. Then what kind of a friend and neighbor would I be? Not that kind that I... [metal tinges and takes out guitar]...would want.
[Squidward continues playing his clarinet until SpongeBob opens his window and he starts to play along. Squidward stops playing his clarinet after noticing SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hi, neighbor!

Squidward:  Yes he said money, but more importantly he said faaaannnnnnssss! And not the type that blows air if you're feeling too hot! The type that wants autographs on everything they got!

Colonel Carper: [Laughs heavily]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah...eh, what's so funny!?
Colonel Carper: You are! And the fact that you think you have any idea what it takes to put on a musical tour!
Mr. Krabs: We have a tour bus, sound equipment, a roadie!
Colonel Carper: You call that a tour bus? [Walks over to Patrick who is still holding the same speaker] You call this sound equipment? That's not a roadie, these are roadies! [Points over to two very large and muscular fish standing beside Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Ahhhh!
Colonel Carper: I'll tell you what, I'll let you open for Ned and the Needlefish on one condition: My roadies get to sabotage your sound equipment and have it blow up during your sound check!
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute...what's that gonna cost me?
Colonel Carper: Oh, that will be free!
Mr. Krabs: [Shakes Carper's fin] Deal!
[Bubble transition to a stage]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, Mr. Squidward. Take it from the top! [Squidward plays a note but the speaker overhead instanly explodes] Doggonit...

Squidward: We're performing at a supermarket!? Driver, turn this bus around! The tour is canceled! Head straight back to the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, Squidward, but that is physically impossible!
Squidward: What!?
Mr. Krabs: Because it's not there anymore!
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab's not there anymore!? Where'd it go?
Mr. Krabs: I pawned it! To raise the cash for the concert tour!
SpongeBob: [Ears explode] You did what!?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah...hard to believe, I know! My heard aches when I think of me old girl cold and lonely. Just sitting in the front window of that dirty pawn shop at the mercy of any random joe who just happens to pass on by.

SpongeBob: Oh? Are there people showing up?
Squidward: Isn't that...what you we’re talking about? [The stage opens up and he smiles and he hears the crowd cheering] Ah...just soak on in, Squiddy, old boy! Pretty invigorating, isn't it? Wait a minute...why are they chanting "Ned and the Needlefish?"
SpongeBob: No, can't you hear them, Squidward? They're saying “Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward...” [Notices the lights turn on and the crowd stop chanting]

SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
[They start swerving on the road with SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick screaming and they eventually drive off a cliff and lands on the ground with the bus tumbling many times. They all get off the bus]
Mr. Krabs: Good news, boys! We only sustained a flat tire! Patrick, go get the spare lad!
Patrick: Uh...oh! Yeah, I can't.
Squidward: What do you mean you can't?

Squidward: No no! Wait! Let me guess: You ate the spare tire?
Patrick: Wow...you're good at guessing...
SpongeBob: Patrick, why didn't you just ask me? [Takes out a small plastic bag with very small tires in it] You know I always bring tiny, snack size tires for in-between meals! You know, I'm kinda hungry now actually. [Eats one of the tires] Hmm...Squidward? They're fat free!
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, I'd like some money for cab fair.
Mr. Krabs: But, Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: But nothing. I'm going home. Now put some cash in my hands so I...
Mr. Krabs: Wah! [Hugs Squidward] But I don't have any money, lad! Not even a nickel! It's all gone! Me Krusty Krab is gone!

Squidward: Get your hands off me! [Walks into another cactus and bumps into a third one] Ow! [Brushes himself off]
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: Don't...[Walks off into the sunset]
SpongeBob: [Climbs on top of the bus and takes out his guitar and starts playing it]♪ Squidward...you must look inward. And then I'm sure that you will see what an awesome band we still could be! Please! Oh please don't quit on us now! I cannot allow this to be our last bow! Now now now! No no no! Nay nay nay! Neh neh neh! NEEEEVER give up! Don't ever give up! We can't let Mr. Krabs go bankrupt! We must keep busy! Never giving up! 
Squidward:  How did I not see this plan was a failure from the start? Being around SpongeBob is bad for my heart! And that's not even the worse part! Supermarkets, retirement homes, birthday parties for kids! My career in music really feels like it has hit the skids! I give up! There is no point! I give up! Mr. Krabs will have to go bankrupt while I'm busy, bittering giving up! 
SpongeBob:  Don't you see? Mr. Krabs needs us terribly! We got it in us to be a huge success! You and I can't settle for less! I promise myself not to shed this tear! 
Squidward:  It's getting really cold out here and I'm four hundred miles from home it will appear! And my feet are hurting oh dear I fear this tentacle-itis is pretty severe! 
Squidward's Foot:  Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah! 
Squidward:  I should probably give up! On this giving up today! This is the part I turn around and play!

SpongeBob and Squidward:  Take a deep breath in an emotional way! 'Cause with my instrument is how I say!  [They both play their respective instruments in a duet. End music scene]
Squidward: Wow! That was actually, kinda good! [Notices the crowd cheering for them]
Harold: Amazing!
Male Fish: Fantastic!
Mr. Krabs: Unbelievable! They actually gathered a crowd! To think that all of these people came out to the middle of the desert to see Squidward and SpongeBob!
Patrick: Or...they came to see the meteor shower that passes through the Aurora Borealis generating a stunning, once-in-a-lifetime light show.
Crowd: [Looking at the beautiful sky] Oh....ah....
Mr. Krabs: [Sets up a stand] Thank you! Come again, please! [Puts money in the register, then in the bag] He he he!
SpongeBob: Look! It's Mr. Krabs! Squidward and I just performed for an crowd of adoring fans!
Mr. Krabs: That's nice! I just made more money than I know what to do with!
Squidward: Well, it looks like they could help you figure it out...
Mr. Krabs: Who? [Notices a very long line then reads a sign] Get Paid Back from Mr. Krabs Line starts here...[Gets sad]
Narrator: One long angry line later...
Colonel Carper: Well, well, well! It looks like this is the end of the line for you! Both literally and figuratively! Hah! Hah! Hah!
Mr. Krabs: Why'd I owe you money for!?
Colonel Carper: Well, let's see: How about damaged sound equipment, loss revenue, and JUST BECAUSE!
Mr. Krabs: I don't owe you a nickel!
Colonel Carper: No! You owe me a MILLION nickels! Roadies! It's collecting time!
Mr. Krabs: Collecting time!? [Gets grabbed by the roadies and they start shaking the money from him]
Colonel Carper: Hah hah hah hah! Yeah! AH HA! Okay boys! Our work here is done! [The roadies drop Mr. Krabs into the ground]
[Bubble transition to the Pawn Shop]
Mr. Krabs: [Sobbing] Well, Krusty Krab, this is goodbye...[Kisses the glass and cries mores] WHY!? WHY!?
SpongeBob: Don't cry, Mr. Krabs. Here! [Takes out a piggy bank] You can have the money for Gary's college fund if that would...[Mr. Krabs quickly takes the money and runs into the Pawn Shop]...help...
Mr. Krabs: [Grabs the Krusty Krab and puts it on his boat] Well, SpongeBob! You ready to get back to doing what we do best?
SpongeBob: [Puts on hat] I'm ready!
Mr. Krabs: That's me boy! [Drives off]
Plankton: [Wheels in a lot of money] Hello, sir! I'd like to purchase the Krusty Krab restaurant you have in your...where is it?
Pawn Shop Owner: Oh, sorry, sir! I just sold it a minute ago. But we do have this slightly used Taco Stand for sale.
[Plankton has a shocked look on his face and the episode ends]

[wind blows]
SpongeBob: [shivers] Oh, cold knees!
[Salesfish drives by, then parks his boat and jumps out with a suitcase]
Salesfish: Well you see you got cold knees, icy joints like [vivian?] patellas? What you need is a pair of longpants!
SpongeBob: Longpants? [twists around looking at the pants spin around him] Well, I don't think I'm ready for looong pants.
Salesfish: Nonsense, no fellers you walk around with shiver shins! [shows SpongeBob's knees with icicles popping out] Give yourself something to leg up [pulls SpongeBob's legs] Join the trouser troupe! [three businessmen marching and hutting] Don't be a slacker, wear slacks!
SpongeBob: Uh..well..I don't...uhhh...Okay! [peels off his old pants and jumps into the longpants] How do I look?
Salesfish: [takes hat off] Excuse me, sir, I was just talking to a little baby schoolboy a second ago, about yay high and...[puts hat on and jumps up] [stutters] It's you! I didn't recognize you with your mature, grownup longpants!
SpongeBob: You're pulling my leg, sir, I don't look like a man! Do I?
Patrick: Hey, man!
SpongeBob: [jumps] He called me a man! And my knees are a perfect 72 degrees! [pulls out wallet and hands salesfish money]
Salesfish: [walks away with money, bubble transition to the Krusty Krab]
Customers: [gasp, talking about SpongeBob's pants while SpongeBob is walking to his workstation]
Customer's son: Is that my daddy?
Customer's mother: I wish! [gawking at SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Uhh, excuse me, sir, that door is for employees only, ohh! It's SpongeBob! [sniffs SpongeBob] There's something different about you today? You seem more, able bodied.
SpongeBob: Yah, it must be the long pants! [in manly tone]
Mr. Krabs: So they are! You'll run the register today! [grabs Squidward] Into the galley with you, Mr. Squidward, and start cooking!
Squidward: [sadly] But, Mr. Krabs? Why?
Mr. Krabs: Well, look, SpongeBob's got longpants on and you've got.. none! [Krustomers ooh]
Squidward: [covers himself, Mr. Krabs throw Squidward into the kitchen, glass shatters, bubble transitions to SpongeBob at the register]
SpongeBob: Ohh! I could get used to this job! Hey Squidward what's on sale this week?
Squidward: Nothing, there is never a sale.
SpongeBob: [pokes head through the serving window] Squidward, how much is the senior discount?
Squidward: There's no senior discount! [looks at burning patties, throws patty onto foot, burns his foot, and grunting and hitting and breaking everything because of the pain]
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: [screams] What?!
SpongeBob: What do I do when the register is $2000 dollars short?
Mr. Krabs: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Alright, alright, that's enough! [picks up SpongeBob and puts him outside of the register] I see it was a mistake to put you behind the register! You’re just looking to good for such a simple meaning of work!
Squidward: [grunts angrily]
Mr. Krabs: You should be the maitre'd! Greeting customers when they come in! Charming the pants off of everyone with your longpants!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Okay! [walks around Krusty Krab, saying hi to everyone] How is that patty treating you, sir? [teeth glisten]
Blue customer: You're an angel!
SpongeBob: No, merely a man, a man in longpants. [elderly spits out soda, missing the longpants, people are spitting food everywhere, just missing SpongeBob's pants, until a ketchup drop stains his pantleg] Oh, my precious longpants!
Mr. Krabs: What's wrong, slick? Your not having trouble with your pants, are ye?
SpongeBob: Nothing like that, Mr. Krabs. I just don't think I'm maitre'd material.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, you're right, you're too good for this place. [two customers burp]
SpongeBob: As much as I hate to admit it, I've outgrown the Krusty Krab. Time for me to move on! [pulls up pants, leaves The Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Where's he going?
Mr. Krabs: A place called... manhood. [bubble transitions to SpongeBob walking on the streets]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Doris, I insist! [puts hand on check]
Doris: Don't be silly!
SpongeBob: Allow me, ladies, I should pay, after all, I am a man, and I'm wearing...[whistles, points at longpants]
Nancy Suzy Fish: What an inseam!
Doris: And those pleats were pretty easy on the eyes!
SpongeBob: [boat splashes water on his pants] AH! Shrimp! Oh, dry cleaning, and one hour! [walks into dry cleaners]

SpongeBob: Wait, what's that? [car with poster on back drives by] The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie is opening tonight! Wow! I totally forgot! [goes back inside] Hey guys, I got an idea! Let's all go to the Mermaid Man movie!
Fancy Fish: [laughs] You're incorrigible! But le cinema is a delightful idea. There is a foreign film at the arthouse I've been meaning to see. It's called, "The Table." [jumpshots to the Seven Seas Cinema, and "The Table"]
SpongeBob: I don't get it. We have been staring at this table for three hours. That table could use a cleaning.
Squidward: SHH! Some people are trying to enjoy le cinema.

Squidward: [grumbling as he is walking away]
SpongeBob: Oh, wait, Squidward, I'll walk you out. [Squidward continues to grumble as he exits the theater] Squidward!
Sandy: Hey SpongeBob, y'all going to see the Mermaid Man movie with us?
Fancy Fish: SpongeRobert? Yoohoo? Are you coming? We're going to drink some more coffee and watch the nightly news.
Sandy: Wow, that sounds pretty grown up, SpongeRobert! [mockingly]
SpongeBob: My pants say yes, yes, yes, but my heart says no! I want to see the Mermaid Man movie!
Fancy Fish: [laughs] Now you really sound like one of those nitwits that frequents the Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob: Not only am I one of those nitwits, I actually work there! [puts on Krusty Krab Hat and hold up dirty Spatula]
Fancy Fish: Ahh! A peasant in longpants!
Pink Fancy Fish: Social-climbing sponge!
Blue Fancy Fish: Poser!
Fancy Fish: Let's leave this bottomfeeder.
Sandy: That-a-boy! I got you a ticket just in case!
SpongeBob: [gasp] Really! [Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick give ticketman their tickets, and enter the movie theatre, but SpongeBob is stopped]
Ticketman: I'm sorry, you can't come in. This movie is too silly for a cultivated gentleman of your pants length. House rules! [SpongeBob walks over to movie poster]
SpongeBob: What? Rated for those in knee-highs only? Doh! I hate these pants! [tries to undo zipper, grunts while doing] [SpongeBob runs to a parking meter and puts his longpants on it, and and stretches his pants] Get off! [a car hits his elongated pants] Oh!, now I know I'm an adult because I've been ripped off by these defective pants! [cries, Mr. Krabs comes out of the movie theater]
Mr. Krabs: What's goin' on? How pathetic, a man, in longpants, crying.
SpongeBob: [sobbing voice] Mr. Krabs, why aren't you watching the movie?
Mr. Krabs: How can I watch the movie with all this blubbering going on out here?
SpongeBob: [regular voice] Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm not ready for long pants, I want my short pants back, but I can't because these are stuck on me.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, for Pete's sake. [uses his pinchers to snap of SpongeBob's legs, knee down] Sorry 'bout the legs boyo.
SpongeBob: [laughs] It's okay! I'm a sponge, remember? [legs grow back]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Well, good! Now, I want you back on the grill tomorrow morning. And if it makes you feel anymore manly, you can do your grilling outdoors!
SpongeBob: Sounds great! And I'll be driving to work.
Driving Instructor: Wait a minute! [he drives up] Oh no you don't! Not with those short pants! [takes the driving license and rips it up]
Mrs. Puff: [in her bedroom with rations and in hunting outfit, shrinks back] I don't know what that was all about, but I'm glad it's over.
The episode opens with the fist falling off the roof of the Chum Bucket. Plankton walks out on the roof and appears to be covering something in his wagon with an old rag.]
Plankton: I'm ready, I'm ready! Ready to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula! Prepare to initiate plan number... hmmm... number. What's the number? Oh well. Who cares?
Karen: Good question.
Plankton: Say what?
Karen: I said good luck!
[Karen pushes the wagon.]
Plankton: That formula will be mine!
[Plankton drives across the street and into front doors of the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: [driving through the customers] Out of my way, pinheads! Move it, move it, move it! [rings the bell at Squidward's cash register] Hey there, snazola! I'm about to show you the advantage of not having a nose. Say hello to... Mr. Stinky!
[Plankton takes of the rag and reveals a skunk named Mr. Stinky. The customers think Mr. Stinky is a cat and look at it in awe.]
Plankton: That's right, everyone. Gather in real close. [pulls out remote] Time to trigger the stench! [pushes button] Yoink!
[The siren on Mr. Stinky's helmet lights up and the helmet lets in a bumble bee. Mr. Stinky gets really scared and sprays fumes of his horrible smell all over the Krusty Krab. The customers including Squidward couldn't take the smell and ran out of the restaurant. The fumes went into the kitchen where SpongeBob was flipping Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [tries to wave away the fumes with his spatula] No, no, no, no, no, no!
[The Krabby Patties get engulfed with the fumes.]
SpongeBob: Not the patties! I'll save you!
[SpongeBob absorbs the fumes with his nose. But because the stench smelled so terrible, he teared up. Mr. Krabs, disturbed by the noise, comes out of his office.]
Mr. Krabs: What's all the racket out here?
[Mr. Krabs sniffs the air. But when he smelled the skunk fumes, his eyes turned green and popped like balloons. The customers continue to panic outside as the HAZMAT Unit condemns the restaurant so they can rid the horrible smell. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs run out with fumes all over them. A firefighter sprays the fumes off of them with a hose.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you alright? What happened?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know. Me eyes were burning! All I saw was a little eyeball and a pair of antenna and... [pauses] Plankton! [SpongeBob gasps] He's still in there! Alone! With me secret formula! He could be doing anything with it! [grabs SpongeBob] He could be reading it!
[Mr. Krabs lets go of SpongeBob and takes off his nose.]
Mr. Krabs: Give me your hand, boy-oh! [grabs SpongeBob's arm] I need to borrow this. [cuts off SpongeBob's arm and puts it on his face as a nose plug] Ok, I'm going in!
SpongeBob: Good luck, Mr. Krabs!
[Mr. Krabs walks back into the restaurant and, using SpongeBob's hand as a fan, waves some of the fumes away for him to see where he's going. Mr. Stinky eats the bumble bee and didn't notice Mr. Krabs sneaking past him. Mr. Krabs makes it to his office and sees Plankton planting dynamite sticks around the safe.]
Mr. Krabs: Why you little...
Plankton: I hope you like percussion, Eugene. Because these drumsticks really go bongo! [laughs]
[Plankton jumps off the safe and ignites the dynamite sticks with the battery on Mr. Krabs' desk, creating a loud explosion. As the smoke clears, the safe opens. But much to Plankton's charging, there is another safe inside.]
Plankton: What? The old safe in the safe routine?
[Mr. Krabs grabs Plankton with SpongeBob's arm.]
Mr. Krabs: Here's another routine! You're the meat in me knuckle sandwich!
Plankton: I'm not hungry!
[Mr. Krabs crushes Plankton with his fists. Plankton is now spattered on his left fist.]
Mr. Krabs: Eww. [throws away Plankton's antenna] SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob comes in with his right leg on the spot where his nose is.]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir. I see the problem.
[SpongeBob regrows his left arm and right leg. He uses his spatula to scoop Plankton off of Mr. Krabs' fist. Mr. Krabs opens the window and SpongeBob flings Plankton out with his spatula. Meanwhile, the HAZMAT Unit takes Mr. Stinky out of the restaurant, puts him in a basket tied with balloons, and lets him float back up to the surface. However, the wind blows the balloons and makes the basket go the other direction. The basket floats into Bikini Bottom where Mr. Stinky sprays his fumes once more. The Bikini Bottomites frantically scream and run around as the horrible smell drives them crazy. Back in the restaurant, SpongeBob blows the fumes out with a fan.]
Mr. Krabs: Whew! That was too close my lad. Three more safes and he would've had me secret formula.
[Mr. Krabs unlocks the second safe.]
Mr. Krabs: Looks like I'm going to have to beef up security around here.
[Mr. Krabs pushes the buttons on the third safe and opens up, revealing a steel container inside. Mr. Krabs takes it out and puts it on his desk.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm going to need you to do me a big favor, laddie.
[Mr. Krabs pushes the buttons on the container and it opens up, revealing the bottle with the secret formula inside.]
Mr. Krabs: [gives SpongeBob the bottle] Take this home with ya and hide it while I reevaluate my security situation.
[Mr. Krabs throws away the container and pounds on his desk. The vibrations of Mr. Krabs' fists shakes the room which also made SpongeBob drop the bottle.]
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs, how do you know it will be safe from Plankton at my house?
Mr. Krabs: Pisha! He'll think it's still here! His tiny brain is incapable of the kind of abstract thinking that is required for reflection. Or thoughtful reasoning and deduction. He cannot ruminate.
[As Mr. Krabs talks to SpongeBob, the antenna Plankton lost was recording everything and Plankton was listening from outside.]
Mr. Krabs: [voiceover] He cannot define the hypothesis. He's a tired clown. He'll never know it's in your house!
Plankton: [gets an idea] Oh, you're right, Professor Krabface! I'm much too simple-minded to look there! [laughs]
[The scene changes to closing time at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob quietly sneaks out and tries to go home with the secret formula. Plankton is seen standing by the sign.]
Plankton: Hey, there.
[SpongeBob hides the formula in one of his holes on his back.]
Plankton: Pleasant night, eh SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously] Oh, uh, yes. It's a very nighty-night for a walkie.
Plankton: Ain't that the truth? Hey, nothing gets past you. One could say you have the formula for honesty.
SpongeBob: Uh, yeah. One could say that I guess. Uh, anyway. I gotta go wash my formula. [freaks out] Hair! Hair! I got to go wash my hair! Uh, good night, Plankton.
[SpongeBob tips his hat, literally revealing the formula on his head. Plankton paused for a bit but relaxes.]
Plankton: Yeah. Gotta keep that hair clean and in a safe place.
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously] Okay, bye!
[SpongeBob leaves to go home.]
French Narrator: The next morning...
SpongeBob: Now remember, Gary. I'm entrusting you with the secret formula.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Stay sharp, Gary. Don't let anyone inside.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Bye, Gary!
[Plankton is on a rock, watching SpongeBob and Gary. He sees SpongeBob leave his home to work at the Krusty Krab. Plankton laughs and comes up with a plan. Inside SpongeBob's house, Gary guards the door until he hears a knock.]
Gary: Meow.
[Gary answers the door and sees Plankton in the disguise as a salesman. Plankton gently pets Gary, but Gary growls angrily at him.]
Plankton: Why, hey there, little fella! Is SpongeBob... [clears throat] I mean your master at home? [Plankton's fake ear slips, but he pushes it back.] Eh, perhaps I could just come inside for a minute and demonstrate our fine snail products.
[Plankton opens his case and shows snail care products.]
Plankton: Shell polish, slime deodorant, chew toys...
Gary: Meow! [Gary slams the door on Plankton, breaking off part of his disguise.]
Plankton: My leg!
[Gary looks through the window and sees Plankton hopping away on one of his stilts from his disguise.]
Plankton: Your friends won't tell you this, but you can really use the slime deodorant, smelly!
French Narrator: Moments later...
[Gary is seen reading the paper on SpongeBob's chair, until he hears the doorbell ringing.]
Gary: Meow?
[Gary answers the door and sees Plankton disguise as a girl scout selling cookies.]
Plankton: Hello, sir... [clears throat and talks in a higher voice] Hello, sir! I'm selling Sweetie Patrol cookies! We have a lovely assortment of fungi and algae flavors.
[Plankton sits on the sofa with the cookie box and holds out a list.]
Plankton: How many delicious boxes can I put you down for? If you order ten boxes, I'll qualify for my bottom-dweller badge. If you order a hundred boxes, I'll get my bling-bling badge. You know, you should hide these from your roommate. She'll eat all of them. [regular voice] If you show me your best hiding place, I'd be happy to help.
[It's soon shown that the sofa was pushed outside of the house with Plankton on it.]
Gary: Meow, meow!
[Gary slams the door. Plankton got so mad, he threw the cookie box on the ground and the box exploded.]
Plankton: [dazed] Note to self: Nitroglycerin is not a substitute for vanilla extract. [his antennas are blown to dust and he faints]
French Narrator: More moments later...
[Gary is seen growling at the window where he spots Plankton making faces at him. Gary comes out of the house.]
Gary: Meow?
[Gary discovers that it was just a decoy and growls in frustration. As he goes to look for Plankton, a hole is seen on the bottom of the house. Inside, it's revealed that the hole was made by Plankton who was actually biting his way in. Plankton spits the pineapple out of his mouth.]
Plankton: I forgot how much I hate pineapple.
[Gary continues to look for Plankton from the living room to the kitchen. As Gary slithered by his litter box, Plankton pops his head out. Gary looked suspiciously at his litter box, but continues looking for Plankton.]
Plankton: [munches on the snail litter] Hey, this snail litter tastes better than pineapple. [swallows] Now, where is that secret formula?
[Plankton hops out and runs into the living room]
Plankton: Where is it? Where is it? Gotta be here somewhere.
[Plankton knocks down a table with a plant.]
Plankton: Nothing in there. [sees one of the hooks on SpongeBob's decoration] Ooh, look at that.
[Plankton grabs the hook and pops SpongeBob's chair. He knocks over the table and looks in the shell phone.]
Plankton: Hello!
[His voice echoes. Plankton jumps on the wall and rips the wallpaper off.]
Plankton: Where the barnacles is it?
[Plankton rips the floor and sees nothing underneath.]
Plankton: Where is it? Where is it? I know you're in here! You're not fooling anybody! I went to college!
[Plankton runs into the kitchen, opens the fridge, and jumps up and down to find the formula. He climbs on the stove and knocks over the fridge. Then he knocks over the stove, walks through the pipe and went into the cupboards.]
Plankton: Nope, nope, nope.
[As he is searching, he throws some dishes, kitchen appliances, and a huge trash can. He comes out with a turkey baster. Plankton thought that the baster could come in handy and puts it in his pocket. Gary is napping in SpongeBob's room until he hears the commotion from downstairs.]
[He goes to see what's making the noise. Plankton manages to hide himself from Gary. Once the coast is clear, he runs upstairs to SpongeBob's room. Gary spots Plankton going upstairs and shutting the door. Plankton searches through SpongeBob's room to find the formula.]
[A light bulb pops out from Gary's eye and lights up, giving Gary an idea on how to catch Plankton.]
[Plankton comes out of SpongeBob's room and heads downstairs. On his way down, he slips on Gary's slime, lands and bounces off a mattress and gets flown into the ceiling fan. The fan spins him around and throws him through the basketball net. Plankton falls through the pipe and lands on a record player. Gary snickers as he caught Plankton into his trap. The player spins Plankton around until he gets caught on the needle. The player flies Plankton onto a board and he lands on a puddle of glue where he gets stuck. The bowling ball on the stool rolls down and board, squishes Plankton, rolls across the floor, and hits ten flower pots like knocking down bowling pins. Then a small vacuum cleaner comes out, sucks up the dirt and broken pottery, and traps Plankton inside. Plankton pops out of the vacuum gasping for air.]
Plankton: Alright, Snail! Let's go! Just you and me!
Gary: Meow!
Plankton: Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
[Gary fights Plankton with his eye stalks. During the fight, Plankton notices an opening in Gary's shell.]
Plankton: Of course! What a fool I've been!
[Plankton climbs into Gary's shell. Inside, the shell has random things covered in slime.]
Plankton: SpongeBob's hidden the secret formula inside Gary's shell! Sheesh! This place is disgusting! I bet it reeks. Good thing I don't have a nose. Huh? [turns around and sees Gary's eye following him] Aye yae yae!
[Gary's eye chases Plankton up, down, left, and right all around the inside of his shell. It wasn't long until SpongeBob returned home from work.]
SpongeBob: Gary, I'm home!
[SpongeBob gasps in shock to see that his house is completely demolished.]
SpongeBob: What happened here? [gasps] My first Krabby Patty! I had it bronzed! Oh, and I was gonna give that to my grandchildren! [gasps] My Mermaid Man collectible underpants! Oh, I could've worn them a thousand more times! [gasps] My glass of water! [teary] I was gonna drink that! Oh, the Krabby Patty formula!
[It's revealed that SpongeBob hid the formula on top of his television in disguise as an antenna.]
SpongeBob: Whew! It's safe and right where I left it.
[SpongeBob notices Gary with his left eye in his shell and growling.]
SpongeBob: Gary, did you do this?
Gary: [growls]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Gary? Something wrong with your shell?
Gary: Meow, meow!
SpongeBob: Something's not right, Gary.
[Gary pulls his eye back out of his shell.]
SpongeBob: I'd better get you to the vet.
Gary: Meow.
[Meanwhile, inside Gary's shell, Plankton continues running around until he reaches a dead-end, which he almost falls into a deep hole.]
Plankton: Ha! I lost him! Now, I'm lost!
[Suddenly, something tilts the shell and Plankton falls into the hole. He lands into the shell's center.]
Plankton: Ah, my head. Oh, I must be in the center of the shell. [he sees a piece of paper stuck in the slime] What's that? [opens it] This is it! Just like I thought! It was hidden here all the time! The secret Krabby Patty formula! It's beautiful!
[Just then, a shimmering light appears.]
Plankton: The heavenly light! I always knew I'd see it once I've gotten the formula! Let me bask in its glory! [sighs]
[However, the light was actually coming from the vet where the doctor opened Gary's shell to find Plankton hallucinating from the fumes inside. And the paper he found is actually a shopping list.]
Doctor: Well, that's odd. Who's that?
SpongeBob: Hey, it's Plankton.
Doctor: What's he got there?
SpongeBob: Looks like one of my old grocery lists.
Doctor: I don't know how he got in there, but the gases inside this shell are making the little guy hallucinate. He would've smelled the gases if he had a nose like most good-hearted people. [sniffs]
Plankton: Ha, ha! I got it! I got it!
[Plankton, still hallucinating, runs out of the vet with the shopping list. The doctor, Gary, and SpongeBob watch strangely as he runs off into the sunset.]
Plankton: I've finally got the formula! It's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine! Open the sparkling apple juice, Karen! Daddy's bringing the bacon home! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!
[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is pulling a trashcan, with Patrick inside, out through the door. Then he pushes it onto the curb.]
SpongeBob: Whew!
[A mail truck drives by and drops a package on the curb.]
SpongeBob: What's that?
Patrick: [pops out of trashcan] Looks like a box.
SpongeBob: Wonder who it belongs to. [jumps on the box] Maybe it says on the other side.
Both: Nope.
Patrick: Oh, look, it's open.
SpongeBob: It is?
Patrick: [opens the box] Yup.
SpongeBob: [peeks inside the box] Ooh. [climbs in the box] It's—it's— [whimpers] It's stuff! [holds up a big pile of sporting equipment]
Patrick: [laughs] Oh, I knew it! But what does this stuff do?
[The sporting equipment falls on SpongeBob and Patrick. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick in the library with a golf club.]
Both: Hmm.
SpongeBob: Ah, this must be for getting books off the top shelf. [knocks books off the top shelf with the golf club]
Patrick: Hey! [laughs]
[SpongeBob knocks more books off the shelf, which they all drop on Patrick. SpongeBob stops and another book falls on Patrick's head.]
Patrick: Wow.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick with the bowling ball in the kitchen.]
Patrick: This must be a whipped cream holder.
[Patrick takes a bottle of whipped cream and pours some through the finger holes on the bowling ball. Then he eats the whipped cream from the ball, but he drops it in his mouth. Then he falls through the floor and into the basement.]
SpongeBob: Ah! Patrick, are you okay?
[Patrick licks some whipped cream from the bowling ball.]
Patrick: Yum.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick in the living room with a catcher's mitt. SpongeBob gives the mitt to Gary, who slithers onto it to sleep.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: This must be a portable snail bed. [rocks Gary to sleep] Rock-a-bye Gary♪
Patrick: I wanna try!
[Patrick hops on the catcher's mitt and pushes Gary aside.]
Gary: Meow.
[Patrick curls himself on the mitt and goes to sleep.]
SpongeBob: Aww. [chuckles]
[The scene changes to Squidward's house. Squidward is in the kitchen, preparing himself a fancy lunch.]
Squidward: [humming] Oh, it may have taken you all morning, Squidward, but this is a meal fit for a king. [bell dings] Oh. My croque-madame is ready. [goes to get his croque-madame]
[A tennis ball crashes through the window and destroys everything including Squidward's meal. Squidward comes back with the croque-madame.]
Squidward: [notices the mess] What the—
[The tennis ball flies into Squidward's croque-madame and gets splattered in the face with its goop. SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing outside.]
Squidward: [shakes the goop off and growls] SpongeBob! Patrick! What do you two think you're—[notices the sporting equipment] wow.
[Squidward runs to the back where SpongeBob and Patrick are wrecking up his garden with a soccer ball and tennis rackets.]
Both: Hi-yah! [laughs]
[The soccer ball destroys the bird bath and bird house as well as the flowers. SpongeBob and Patrick go to hit the soccer ball again right before Squidward arrives.]
Squidward: My begonias! What are you lunk heads doing with all this equipment?
Both: Equipment?
Squidward: You don't know what this stuff is?!
Both: Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
Squidward: This is a soccer ball...[kicks the soccer ball in SpongeBob's face] that is a tennis racket, [shoves the tennis racket in SpongeBob's face] and these are a couple of morons! [bashes SpongeBob and Patrick's face into each other] Now, be quiet! And clean up all of your sports junk!
Both: [confused] What's a "sportz?"
Squidward: [groans] Sports are games you play for points. The points determine the winner of the game.
Patrick: Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I love games!
SpongeBob: Me too! You must know a lot about "sportz," Squidward. Will you teach us how to play?
Squidward: I can't think of anything I'd rather do less than—
[Squidward's angel appears on his right shoulder.]
Angel Squidward: Now now, Squidward. You need to help them. Played incorrectly, sports can be very dangerous.
[Squidward's devil appears on his left shoulder.]
Devil Squidward: Yeah, he's right! You should teach 'em to play wrong, 'cause it's payback time!
[The tennis ball hits Squidward's angel.]
Angel Squidward: Let 'em have it, right between the eyes. [disappears]
[Squidward's devil disappears as well.]
Squidward: You know, on second thought, I'd be happy to teach you all about sports, SpongeBob. [chuckles evilly]
[The scene changes to Squidward setting up a horseshoe toss game.]
Squidward: All right, the object of this game is to throw the horseshoe around the stick.
SpongeBob: Ah, seems easy enough.
Squidward: Sure, but you have to do it... [hold up a blindfold] blindfolded. [ties the blindfold around SpongeBob's face and gives the horseshoe to SpongeBob]
[Patrick licks his horseshoe just as Squidward puts the blindfold around Patrick's eyes.]
Patrick: Um, do we throw now?
Squidward: Yes.
SpongeBob: At the same time?
Squidward: Yes! Throw it at the same time! Throw!
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [throws the horseshoe]
[Patrick throws his horseshoe as well. SpongeBob's horseshoe hits Patrick in the head while Patrick's horseshoe hits SpongeBob in the face.]
SpongeBob: Ow! [sticks his tongue out with his eyeballs showing; then puts his eyeballs back in place] Aw, we didn't hit the sticks. Did we do bad?
Patrick: [his face puffs up] My face hurts.
Squidward: Oh, no, no, no. You both did good. Pain is—uh, worth points. You know the phrase, "no pain, no gain."
Patrick: [laughs] I want pain points! [kicks his horseshoe and a seahorse falls on him]
Squidward: Yeah, that's great. Now do it—oh, 100 more times. [throws the horseshoe]
SpongeBob: Yeah!
[The horseshoe falls SpongeBob's nose. SpongeBob throws the horseshoe again, but gets hit in the face with Patrick's horseshoe.]
SpongeBob: Ow!
[SpongeBob and Patrick keep hitting themselves with each other's horseshoe while Squidward lays back and watches them in amusement.]
Squidward: Oh, Squiddy, you're a genius.
[SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to Squidward and appear to brutally beaten by Squidward's so-called game.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, can the game be over now? All this pain is starting to hurt.
Squidward: Oh, sorry. There's no way to end the game without one of you winning.
[SpongeBob and Patrick groan. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick wearing ice skates and are around to race each other on Squidward's command.]
Squidward: Ready...set...go! [fires the toy gun and chuckles]
[SpongeBob and Patrick start running, but as they running, they are having a hard time running with the ice skates as they appear to be uncomfortable. SpongeBob trips and falls, getting sand with worms in his mouth.]
SpongeBob: [spits the sand out of his mouth] Squidward, are you sure we're doing this right? These running shoes are really hurting my ankles.
Squidward: Oh, you're absolutely doing it right. Try to pick up the pace, though.
[Patrick appears behind SpongeBob and slices him in half with his ice skate.]
Patrick: Comin' through!
[The two halves of SpongeBob stand up and goes to catch up to Patrick. Two sharks come by and notices what SpongeBob and Patrick are doing.]
Shark Son: I wanna play, Daddy.
Shark Dad: No, son. We're sports "fans." We just watch.
[The Shark Dad pulls up a chair and sits down while his son takes up a foam hand. SpongeBob and Patrick made it to the finishing line.]
Squidward: And...time. Let's see those ankles.
[SpongeBob and Patrick's ankles puff up from the strain of running while wearing the ice skates.]
Squidward: [gasps] Oh, yeah, those look bad. You both get—mm, 50 points. Why not?
Patrick: Hey, then we're still tied!
[The scene changes to people walking to the backyard of SpongeBob and Squidward's houses. In the backyard, there's a sporting arena containing several different fields: a baseball field, a bowling rink, a soccer field, a basketball court, a football field, a golf course, and some gymnasium sections. SpongeBob is holding up a catcher's mitt and a tennis racket while wearing a headband. Patrick shoots footballs in SpongeBob's face with the football shooter. SpongeBob comes back with footballs lodged in his mouth and gives a thumbs up. The scoreboard changes from 70 to 72, and they're still tied. Patrick hits the bowling ball with the golf club, but the club breaks and hits SpongeBob in the face. The scoreboard changes from 82 to 84, and they're still tied. SpongeBob and Patrick are on the balance beam over a jellyfish hive. The beam breaks and they both get stung by jellyfish. The scoreboard changes from 88 to 90, and they're still tied. Meanwhile, Sandy is shown walking down the street with a magnifying glass.]
Sandy: Hmm. Hmm. Where is it? Where is it? Hmm. Ah-ha! There's my box of sports gear. It must've fallen off the mail truck. But what happened to all the equipment?
[The bell dings and the crowd cheers.]
Sandy: What was that?
[Sandy runs to the sporting arena and notices SpongeBob and Patrick beating themselves up with boxing gloves on their feet.]
Sandy: Huh? SpongeBob, what's going on?
SpongeBob: Oh, hey—[SpongeBob and Patrick hit each other] Sandy. Patrick and I are—[SpongeBob and Patrick hit each other again] in the middle of a sports game.
[Patrick jumps onto SpongeBob.]
Sandy: This sure don't look like any sport I've seen before.
[SpongeBob and Patrick hit each other again.]
SpongeBob: I believe it's called kickboxing, or something?
[Patrick falls down.]
Sandy: Well, whatever it is, it seems to be causing you lots of pain.
[SpongeBob hits Patrick.]
Patrick: Ow! Sure is. [gets hit again] Ooh!
Sandy: Why not stop playing it if it hurts so bad?
Patrick: We can't stop...[panting] Until we break our tie.
Sandy: Says who?
[The trumpeters play and fog steams out from between the booths.]
Shark Son: It's the rule giver.
[The crowd murmurs as Don the Whale, Frank the Muscular Goldfish, and Larry the Lobster carry Squidward, who is in a grim reaper outfit, onto the field. They set him down and the crowd cheers.]
Sandy: I ain't never heard of a rule giver.
Squidward: [flips his hood] I prefer "King of Sports," but you can never tell what will catch on with the small folk.
Sandy: You're making up a game where SpongeBob and Patrick hurt themselves, and you won't let them stop?!
Squidward: I'm just giving the people what they want.
Sandy: That's pretty low, Squidward, even for you. I'm putting a stop to this. SpongeBob and Patrick have had enough!
[SpongeBob and Patrick appear brutally beaten up by Squidward's so-called games.]
Squidward: See? They're fine. Let the games resume.
[Sandy grumbles and the audience cheers.]
Sandy: Oh, I don't think so. Y'all want to see a game? Fine. Squidward, I challenge you to a game—a game of basketball. Winner decides the fate of SpongeBob and Patrick.
[Sandy throws basketballs in Squidward's face.]
Squidward: Huh? [the crowd cheers] Me? Play sports? No, no. I'm mostly in an advisory position.
Jimmy Gus: Aw, come on! We came to see some action! Play the squirrel! Play the squirrel!
Crowd: Play the squirrel! Play the squirrel!
Sandy: See you on the court, Your Highness. [shoves the crown down Squidward's face]
[The scene changes to Squidward and Sandy on the basketball court.]
Sandy: Hey, Squidward, one more thing. We're playing San Antonio rules.
Squidward: San "A—what—io" rules?
Sandy: Check!
[Sandy throws the basketball in Squidward's belly. Then she jumps onto Squidward's head and shoots the basketball into the net. The crowd cheers.]
Squidward: Oh, that was a foul!
Sandy: Tell it to your mama, Squidward!
Squidward: Mama?
Mrs. Tentacles: Don't want to hear it.
Sandy: Next round's soccer.
Squidward: What the what?
Sandy: Sure. Every time you score, you pick a new sport. I thought you knew all the rules, Squidward.
Squidward: Well, uh, yeah, well, of course I do. Yeah.
Sandy: Good, then block this!
Squidward: [notices the soccer net in back of him] Block what?
[Sandy kicks the soccer ball and headbutts into the net. The net bounces the ball back, hitting Squidward in the head. Squidward pulls his head back up and the crowd cheers.]
Squidward: Oh, come on, I wasn't even ready!
Sandy: No time outs! Football round!
[The horn blares and Sandy charges towards Squidward with the football. She rams Squidward onto the football goalpost. Then she throws the football with her tail through the goalpost. The football hits Squidward and the crowd cheers.]
Squidward: [panting] Just give me a second to—
[Sandy comes up from behind and stuffs Squidward in a jellyfishing net. She swings the net and sends Squidward flying to the soccer ball goal and into the pooling table. Squidward pulls himself out of the table. Sandy hits the eight ball and it flies into Squidward's head. The eight ball comes out through Squidward's nose. Sandy takes out a plate and Squidward's face falls into pieces. Squidward's face is now made into calamari.]
Announcer: And the winner is...Sandy Cheeks!
[The crowd cheers. Sandy is proud that she won the challenge while Squidward feels defeated and broken-down from the games.]
Sandy: Good game, Squidward. [shakes Squidward's hand]
Squidward: Ow, ow, ow.
[SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to them. SpongeBob is in several casts and bandages while Patrick's severed head is on the wheelchair.]
SpongeBob: Wow, Sandy! That was amazing!
Patrick: Yeah, I liked the part where you did that thing with the ball and stuff.
Sandy: [laughs] Thanks, boys. Looks like we're all done here. That goes for you too. I'm ending your game.
Patrick: [gulps] But we're still tied.
Sandy: Don't worry, I'm declaring you both winners.
Both: Yeah! We're winners! We're winners! We're winners!
[Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick hug each other.]
Sandy: Aww, don't worry, Squidward. [hugs Squidward] You're a winner too.
Squidward: I hate winning. [his head explodes] Ow.
[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Squidward is playing his clarinet very poorly and is driving the customers crazy.]
Harold: [pulls out his eyeballs and plugs his ears] Ah.
Nat Peterson: Make it stop! Ah! [crashes into a pole]
[Mr. Krabs exits his office and hears the horrible music Squidward's playing.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh. [sprays pest spray on the sour notes and groans] Mister Squidward! Quit that calamitous cacophony! You're driving me customers batty!
[Tom growls and crushes his drink in anger.]
Squidward: [pulls his clarinet out of his mouth] Well, I'm sorry you rubes can't enjoy jazz. I am practicing for a very important open mic night tonight.
Mr. Krabs: Well, practice somewhere else! This here's a jazz-free zone! [slaps Squidward hard, then holds his head to a "no jazz" sign]
[An eel customer sobs and walks out after being offended by the "no jazz" sign. Mr. Krabs lets go of Squidward and his head spins around.]
Squidward: [jibbers] Fine! I'll take my music to the other people then. [shoves his hat on Mr. Krabs' head]
Mr. Krabs: [pokes his eyes out through the hat] And if I see that clarinet again, it'll be going into the woodwind chipper! You hear me?
[Squidward grumbles as he leaves the Krusty Krab. Squidward walks up to the "Near Mint Comic Books" store where Bubble Bass is talking to his friends.]
Bubble Bass: As you can see, this is the first generation Talking Suburban Dad figurine, with realistic burger-flipping motion.
Suburban Dad Toy: Not right now, Billy. Daddy's had a long day.
Bubble Bass' friends: Ooh.
[Suddenly, their moment was interrupted when Squidward's sour music annoys them. It also makes Bubble Bass drop his action figure and it breaks its arm.]
Bubble Bass: Suburban Dad! No! [walks out and sees Squidward] You? [jumps up and slams on Squidward; Squidward crawls comes out injured] You—will remove that subpar woodwind from the premises, ere I snap its reed!
[Squidward pulls himself out of Bubble Bass and rolls back home. He crashes at his door, with his clarinet pierced through the door. Squidward falls down to the ground and pulls his clarinet from the door.]
Squidward: Can't practice anywhere in this town. [slams the door] Bunch of tasteless clowns! [grumbles and plays his clarinet outside his house's window]
Patrick: [playing with rocks] Smashy, smashy! Bang, bang! Sma–oh! [covers his ears] Ow! What is that noise? [looks up and sees Squidward playing his clarinet] Oh, no. Squidward's being attacked by that pointy screeching monster. Don't worry, Squidward! I'll save you! [throws a rock]
Squidward: [stops playing] What are you– [gets hit by the rock and crashes inside his house; appears without a head] Hm? Uh? Hm? [his head is pinned to the mantelpiece and his clarinet has a rock lodged in its mouth] Oh!
Patrick: You're welcome!
[The scene changes to Squidward about to put his clarinet on a pillow while he prepares to take a little nap.]
Squidward: [humming] It's time for our pre-performance nap. Tonight, we change lives with our music. [kisses his clarinet, puts it on a pillow and leaves to take a nap]
French Narrator: One nap later...
Squidward: [appears in a suit] Are you ready, my dear? We've got the– [gasps and screams]
[His entire living room has been damaged and his clarinet was stolen. The episode's background color turns into black and white.]
Squidward: [narrating] And that's how it began. My life smashed to bits. My living room covered in broken dreams. Without my clarinet, the world was a drab and colorless place. [picks up the pillow and hears SpongeBob giggling outside] And that's when I saw him, my first suspect. [SpongeBob is playing in the puddles] When it comes to paying the stupid bill, SpongeBob always tipped 20%. [SpongeBob puts sand in his head and drains it out of his holes] He had to be involved. [walks over to SpongeBob] SpongeBob, what have you done with my clarinet?
SpongeBob: Ooh, Squidward, you're so hard-boiled. Are you playing a game? Oh, oh, can I play?
Squidward: I know you stole my clarinet! Tell me [slaps him] where! [slaps him again] It! [slaps him again] Is!
SpongeBob: [slaps himself] I [slaps himself again] Don't! [slaps himself again] Know! [giggles] It couldn't have been me, Squidward. I have an alibi. I was at Grandma's house all day and I have the kissy marks to prove it, [points to the kissy marks on his head] see? There's room for one more.
[Squidward is grossed out and he pushes SpongeBob away.]
Squidward: [narrating] His alibi was solid. Only a family member could stomach putting their lips on this fool.
SpongeBob: You know, we have lots of friends. Maybe they could help us find your clarinet.
Squidward: I don't have friends. I have suspects.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, don't you know a suspect is just a friend you haven't cleared of charges yet? [gets pushes down by Squidward] So... can I help you solve your case? Please, please, please?
Squidward: Try not to get in the way.
SpongeBob: Yeah! It's a play-date! I mean... [changes into his detective clothes] All right, I'll partner up with you this time. [flips a coin and it disappears] Huh?
[The scene changes to Squidward and SpongeBob driving in the streets as rain pours down.]
Squidward: [narrating] My... [clears throat] partner and I decided to check out my next suspect, the owner of a local greasy spoon. I figured a little "Good cop, bad cop" would get his jaw flapping so I–
SpongeBob: [narrating] Oh! Can I be the bad cop? Please, please, can I, please?
Squidward: [narrating] Yes, if you get out of my hard-boiled narration!
SpongeBob: [narrating] Sorry. [flips coin]
[They drive up to the Krusty Krab. They walk up to the front doors. SpongeBob flips a coin and the coin disappears.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [gets pulled into the restaurant by Squidward]
[Mr. Krabs is in his office playing with his money.]
Mr. Krabs: What the–
[Squidward comes in and kicks away the desk.]
Squidward: Hey, Mister Krabs, how are you doing? Can I get you some tea? Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? [gives Mr. Krabs a cup of tea and he sips it] Now, where were you earlier–
SpongeBob: You seem hungry, dear. Home-cooked meal? [gives Mr. Krabs a microwavable meal]
Squidward: What are you doing, SpongeBob? [clears throat and pulls out a nail filer] Manicure?
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [gets his claw filed by Squidward]
SpongeBob: [pulls in a makeover] Makeover? [puts Mr. Krabs in the makeover machine, and out comes Mr. Krabs with a long, blonde wig. SpongeBob sprays him with "Make Up in a Can" afterward]
Squidward: Warm blanket? [puts the blanket onto Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: New shoes? [pushes Squidward]
Squidward: Hey!
[SpongeBob puts shoes on Mr. Krabs' feet.]
Mr. Krabs: [rips the blanket] Enough!
SpongeBob: Hey, check out the dame.
[Mr. Krabs now appears as a woman. Squidward is grossed out at the appearance and nearly throws up.]
Mr. Krabs: What in the salty seven seas are you two doing?!
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, we're playing "Good cop, good cop." Sorry, Squidward, I don't know how to be the bad cop!
Squidward: [grabs and pulls down a hanging lamp over Mr. Krabs] We're looking for my clarinet, Eugene. I know you broke into my house this afternoon! I know you stole it! Now fess up!
Mr. Krabs: This afternoon? Well, I was–I've been here all day, counting me money! Just look at me butt groove! [points to his chair with butt grooves]
SpongeBob: [rubs his finger onto the butt groove] Good contours. [pushes on the seat] And still warm. Story checks out. [sniffs his finger, but notices it is extremely smelly]
Squidward: All right, Mr. Krabs, we'll mosey along this time. [leaves] Come on, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Mm, hmm. [leaves as his eyes extend; he pulls them back]
Mr. Krabs: Boys, if you two do find that clarinet, could you bring it to me? So I can smash it to pieces!
[The scene changes Squidward and SpongeBob pulling up to the "Near Mint Comic Books" store to ask their next suspect.]
Squidward: [narrating] We pulled up to the local dweeb market, where I hoped to find my next suspect: maven of all things moronic, Bubble Bass. The sign said closed, but I could hear their nerdy murmuring inside.
[Bubble Bass is playing a board game with his friends inside the store.]
Bubble Bass: And then, from the depths of the barbeque, comes the ferocious, fire-breathing [pulls out his suburban dad action figure] Dad!
Squidward: [kicks the door] Bubble Bass! [his foot cramps up] Ow!
Bubble Bass: Huh? [runs away]
SpongeBob: [stops Squidward from chasing Bubble Bass] Squidward, wait! [pulls out his Mermaid Man action figure] Let him handle this.
[The scene becomes an imaginary action show where SpongeBob's Mermaid Man action figure chases Bubble Bass's Suburban Dad action figure. They climb up the book shelves, knocking over several comics.]
Suburban Dad: [throws actions figures] Take that! And that! [Mermaid Man punches them away] What? [he gets corned to the edge] All right. You've got me cornered. But I won't give up without a fight!
Mermaid Man: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Mermaid Man and Suburban Dad go head to head with one another.]
Squidward: [narrating] It was a real knockdown, drag-out fight. Or it would've been, if it hadn't been just two sad adults playing with toys.
Bubble Bass: Wait. Wait! Roll the dice. Did his punch land?
Bubble Bass' friend: [rolls the dice] It's a hit!
[Mermaid Man punches Suburban Dad. Suburban Dad falls but is grabbed by Mermaid Man.]
Suburban Dad: Huh? Oh. [exhales]
SpongeBob: Where were you this afternoon? Where's Squidward's clarinet?
Bubble Bass: I don't know what you're talking about. I was here all day. I swear it!
[Mermaid Man loses his grip and the Suburban Dad action figure falls and breaks into pieces.]
Suburban Dad: Billy, don't make me turn this boat around.
Bubble Bass: No! I still could have passed you off as near mint! [sobbing]
Bubble Bass' friends: [walk up to comfort Bubble Bass] Aww. So, sorry, man.
SpongeBob: I am so sorry for your loss.
Squidward: I'm not. Come on, SpongeBob, let's go. This is a dead end. [leaves with SpongeBob]
[The scene changes to Squidward's house.]
Squidward: [walk in and wrings out his hat] Well, there's only one more person on my list of suspects.
SpongeBob: [flips a coin] Patrick Star?
Squidward: Um, yeah, how'd you know?
[SpongeBob points to Patrick, who is eating some goo at the crime scene of where the Squidward's clarinet was taken.]
Patrick: Hey, guys!
Squidward: Well, the criminal returns to the scene of the crime. Spill the beans, Jack! Where's my clarinet?
Patrick: I don't know who Jack is! But I would like some beans!
Squidward: Let me lay it out for you, Chucko. When I took my nap today, you broke in through the window, smashed my living room, got that goo you're eating all over and stole my clarinet!
Patrick: Oh, this isn't goo. It's jelly! The good stuff too, from real jellyfish. [eats some jelly]
SpongeBob: [flips coin] Real jellyfish jelly? You can only find that in one place. That means our thief...
Squidward: Must have been at Jellyfish Fields! Let's go!
SpongeBob: Right behind you, pal. [flips coin and it disappears] Huh? [gets dragged away by Patrick] Whoa!
[The scene changes to Squidward, SpongeBob and Patrick driving to Jellyfish Fields.]
Squidward: [narrating] When we arrived at Jellyfish Fields, I could already hear my clarinet's dulcet tones.
[Squidward, SpongeBob and Patrick pull over, step out of the car and see a giant hive in the middle of the fields. It is revealed that the culprit who stole Squidward's clarinet is a group of jellyfish who are blowing through it to make music.]
Squidward: My baby! [grabs the clarinet from the jellyfish] Ha!
[The episode turns its color back on.]
SpongeBob: Oh! So it was the jellyfish that took your clarinet. But from the sound of it, I'd say they've learned that crime doesn't play! [giggles and Patrick slaps him]
[Squidward plays music with his clarinet.]
SpongeBob: Look, Squidward. The jellyfish are fans of your music.
Patrick: We should solve another mystery now.
SpongeBob: Yeah, uh, how about the mystery of where all my coins went? [flips a coin and it disappears] Huh? [coins fall on him]
Patrick: Solved!
[The scene changes to nighttime. The hive is now a nightclub where jellyfish can dine and watch the show.]
Jellyfish: [a jellyfish bouncer allows the jellyfish to enter] Thank you.
[The jellyfish sit back and watch Squidward play his clarinet on stage. SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick watch the show while wearing earplugs.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, yeah! Yeah, Squidward! [whistles]
[Mr. Krabs curls his hair and Patrick eats a bowl of jellyfish jelly.]
Squidward: [narrating] And that's how it ended. Clarinet returned. Case closed. Another mystery solved by: Squidward Tentacles, Jazz Detective.
[The episode begins at the Bikini Bottom pool.]
Kid #1: It's too high. I can't!
Kid #2: Cannonball! [jumps on the diving board]
Kid #1: Ohh!
[The bigger kid jumps into the pool and causes a big wave, splashing everything. A parent puts water wings on her daughters arms.]
Water wing girl's mother: Now you've got water wings. Try them. [her daughter flaps her arms and flies up high] Hmm? Huh?
Water wing girl: Ahh-ahh-ahh! [vanishes in the sky]
SpongeBob: [playing Marco Polo with his eyes closed] Marco! [touches a swimmer's back]
Swimmer: Ehh.
SpongeBob: [opens the swimmer's back] Marco?
Joshua: [licking his lollipop] No, I'm Joshua.
SpongeBob: [closes the swimmer's back] Okay, bye. [Patrick is hiding underwater] Marco.
Patrick: [through bubble as it pops] Polo. [pops out of the water]
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
SpongeBob: Marco!
[Patrick swims over to a group of senior citizens.]
Nurse: [blows whistle] Shady Shoals residents, out of the pool!
Old Man #1: I pooped.
Clarabelle: Come along, Mortimer. [blinks her old eyes and pulls Patrick out of the pool]
Patrick: Huh? [notices his wrinkled up body] Oh. Huh? I'm covered in wrinkles.
Clarabelle: Oh, we all are, dear. I call them oldie foldies. [flips her flabby arm] Hurry, Mortimer. Shady Shoals is serving prune ice cream today.
Patrick: Dah! Ice cream, oh, oh! [runs up to the bus, knocking over Clarabelle and an old man] Wait for me! [gets in the bus and it drives away, dragging Clarabelle and the old man in the back]
SpongeBob: Marco! Marco! [touches Marco's face] Marco?
Marco: [grumbles and grabs SpongeBob] Yeah, I'm-a Marco! What do you want?
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't want you. I want Patrick.
Marco: Then stop a-yellin' my name! [drops SpongeBob and leaves]
SpongeBob: Ugh. [softly] Marco.
Larry: [through megaphone while holding and old man licking a lollipop] Attention, everyone. We found a lost elderly gentleman who goes by the name of Mortimer. Can anyone claim him? [gets no answer and stuffs Mortimer in a lost and found box]
[The bus drives up to Shady Shoals where it is about to drop the senior citizens off.]
Patrick: Come on, let's move it! I want prune ice cream.
Senior Citizens: [gets picked up by Patrick] Ohh.
[Patrick carries the senior citizens into Shady Shoals and flops to the ground. The senior citizens cheer and Patrick pulls himself together.]
Clarabelle: Mortimer, ice cream time.
Patrick: [gets up] Ahh! [pants as he runs to the table, pushes everyone aside and eats the prune ice cream; he belches out the three bowls then starts to feel pain in his head] Brain freeze!
[Patrick's head opens and his brain is covered in ice and snow. Patrick passes out unconscious on the floor.]
Nurse: Clear! [zaps Patrick with the defibrillator] Clear! [zaps Patrick's brain with the defibrillator, but his brain ignites fire; she whimpers and backs away]
[Patrick's brain is burnt to a crisp and the smoke wakes Patrick up.]
Patrick: Oh. [gets up] Ah. [picks up his brain, squirts it with ketchup and eats it] Brain food.
[The scene changes to Patrick knitting a blanket with Mary and Clarabelle.]
Clarabelle: Eh?
Mary: Ehh?
Patrick: [his face is on the blanket] Eh. [rips his face off with the blanket] Oh. [laughs with Mary and Clarabelle]
[The scene changes with Patrick, who is getting old and wrinklier at that time, playing shuffleboard with some old men. He gets a turn, but his arm falls off. He and the two old men share a laugh. The scene changes to Patrick watching an old lady on the verge of dying in her bed. The heart monitor stops beeping and Patrick becomes sad. He puts the blanket over the old lady's head.]
Old lady #1: Gotcha! [she and Patrick laugh]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob walking in a dark alley with his eyes closed and still playing Marco Polo.]
SpongeBob: Marco!
[Marco grumbles and climbs down the fire escape.]
SpongeBob: Marco!
Marco: You! What I tell youse about-a yellin' my name?
SpongeBob: Ahh! I-I don't remember. Um, sometimes it helps me to remember if I go into a trance. [rubs his head and shows his brain then a white farmhouse] I'm seeing a small farmhouse painted white. Does that have any significance to you?
Marco: My parents had a white farmhouse.
SpongeBob: What's this? A baby has been born. A boy. There is much happiness.
Marco: That's-a me. I was-a born there.
SpongeBob: They are about to name the boy...
Marco: Marco. They named him Marco. It's Marco. Marco!
SpongeBob: Polo.
Marco: Ahh! [grabs SpongeBob] If I catch anyone a-yellin' my name again, I'm-a gonna hurt them. [throws SpongeBob away]
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo! [screams and lands right in front of Shady Shoals where a sleeping Patrick is now old and wrinkly; gets up] Marco.
Patrick: Polo.
SpongeBob: Ah-ha-ha! Found you! Now it's your turn to call Marco.
Patrick: [wakes up] Do I know you, young man?
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me. Remember? Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?♪
Patrick: I don't know. A wizard?
SpongeBob: [pulls up a tub, jumps in and absorbs the water] Absorbent and yellow and porous is he♪ [spits out the water] Ehh.
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants!
SpongeBob: [plays the final notes with his nose like a flute and laughs] The one and only. Okay, now it's your turn to call Marco Polo.
Patrick: Whoa-oh, I can't do that. I'm all wrinkled now. I do old stuff. [his forehead and eyebrows fall on his face]
SpongeBob: Old stuff? Like what?
Patrick: [lifts up his forehead and eyebrows] Check it out. [shows SpongeBob a rocking chair] This is called doddering. [slowly dodders to the rocking chair] Oh, here's another thing I do now. It's called gumming. [smacks his gums and lips] Neat, huh? [laughs] Now, uh, this part's really fun. It's called complaining. [grabs Joshua] These kids today, they don't know diddly squat!
[Joshua's mother grabs her son and drags him away.]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick, those are all great things, but wouldn't you rather go jellyfishing? [holds up a jellyfishing net]
Patrick: [imagines a jellyfish and it stings him] Ohh! No, that hurts.
SpongeBob: We could build sand castles. [holds up a toy shovel]
Patrick: [imagines a sand castle and someone kicks it in Patrick's neck] It's not structurally sound.
SpongeBob: Well, how 'bout blowing bubbles? [holds up a bottle of bubble with a bubble wand] Nothing bad about a bubble]
Patrick: [imagines a bubble and it floats in front of him] Ooh. [it pops in his face] Are you trying to kill me, son?
SpongeBob: No, I just think we should act our age. [forms a cushion fort and pops out at the bottom] Remember when we used to look forward to rainy days and building cushion forts?
Patrick: These days, I only look forward to my final exit. [goes into a cushion coffin]
Clarabelle: Oh, he was too young. [puts flowers on the cushion coffin]
Patrick: [pops out] No, I wasn't!
Senior Citizens: No, he wasn't. [climbs in the cushion coffin] We are not young.
SpongeBob: Come on, people. Just 'cause you're old doesn't mean you're rotting fish. You're still vital, full of life. Fresh.
Old Man #2: Fresh, you say? Ahh. [his mouth rips off]
[SpongeBob pulls Patrick and the senior citizens out of Shady Shoals as they sit on a rug. He drags them to a nearby coral tree.]
SpongeBob: Okay, you young-at-hearters, today you are gonna climb that tree.
[Patrick and the senior citizens get up and attempt to climb it.]
SpongeBob: [through megaphone] Yes, yes, that's right! Put those flabby arms to use! Laugh at your lumbago! Cackle at your cataracts!
[Patrick and the senior citizens try their best, but couldn't due to being old and frail. One old man falls down from the branch and crumbles to dust. SpongeBob sweeps the old man up and revives him by watering him with a watering can.]
Old Man #3: Is it nap time yet?
SpongeBob: Nope! It's time for the dance party! Everybody on board.
[Patrick and the senior citizens sit on the rug and SpongeBob drags them away. The scene changes to dancing arena where SpongeBob attempts to help Patrick and the senior citizens dance.]
SpongeBob: Are you ready to get down?
Patrick and the senior citizens: Yeah. [get down on the floor and fall asleep]
SpongeBob: No, not like that. Like this! [turns on ragtime music]
[Patrick and the senior citizens stand up and dance to the ragtime music.]
Patrick: Now-now-now-now you're talking.
SpongeBob: Now, let's kick it up a hundred notches! [turns on loud dance music] Yeah!
[The loud dance music causes Patrick and the senior citizens to get heart attacks.]
Patrick: Oh, what's happening?
[Patrick and the senior citizens pass out unconscious to the floor.]
SpongeBob: Oh, clear! [zaps the floor with the defibrillator. reviving Patrick and the senior citizens]
[Patrick and the senior citizens laugh and Patrick zaps his head with the defibrillator. The scene changes to SpongeBob dragging Patrick and the senior citizens across the sidewalk.]
SpongeBob: Isn't it great to get outdoors with the fresh air and sunshine?
Old Lady #2: Stop this rug! Bunny Buns! Bunny Buns!
Patrick and the senior citizens: Bunny Buns! Bunny Buns!
SpongeBob: Bunny Buns? That's a good idea! Nothing makes people feel young like arcade games, grease and sugar.
[Inside Bunny Buns, children are riding on kiddie rides, eating pizza, playing arcade games, and swimming in the ball pit. Several kids are watching the animatronic animal stage show. Patrick is whacking the animatronic badger with his cane.]
Patrick: You're coming in too fast on the bridge and you're blowing clams! [whacks the robot's head off and lands on a kid's pizza; the kid cries and Patrick listens through an ear trumpet] Now that's what I call jazz!
SpongeBob: [pushes Patrick away] Ha, ha. So sorry. Let me just take this. [takes the severed robot head and leaves]
[One old man is playing Bunny Bash while using Joshua as the hammer. Joshua's mom grabs her son and drags him away again. An old couple attempts to eat pizza, but they end up pulling their dentures out.]
SpongeBob: I can help you with that. [pull the dentures off the pizza slices and stuffs them back into the old couples mouths] Eww.
Old Man #1: Hey! [laughs, shakes a soda can and squirts soda at Patrick]
SpongeBob: Old people, behave!
Old Man #1: [gets squirted by Patrick] Whoa! [flies into a skee ball machine and comes out in ticket form] 23 skidoo!
SpongeBob: Oh. [groans as he straightens out the old man]
Patrick: [screams] SpongeBob! [struggles to swim in the ball pit] I'm drowning! [sinks into the ball pit]
SpongeBob: I'm coming, Patrick! [jumps into the ball pit and pulls Patrick out]
[SpongeBob performs CPR and makes him spit out several balls and Joshua. Joshua's mom grabs her son and drags her away again.]
Patrick: Thanks, old-timer.
SpongeBob: Oh, you're welcome. What, who are you calling old-timer? [looks at his reflection on the screen of a video game console and sees himself getting old and wrinkly] Whoa. Where have the years gone? [he and Patrick walk slowly together, until he falls flat on the floor] I'm losing steam. [spews out steam from his holes]
Patrick: Wait, hey, man. Don't make a scene in front of all my old friends. [SpongeBob's steam turns Patrick's skin moist and his cane disappears, making him young again] Oh. [looks at his reflection on the screen of a video game console and sees himself young again] Ohh. Now I can't dodder.
[The scene changes back to Shady Shoals and SpongeBob is resting on a rocking chair with a heart monitor next to him. Patrick walks up and puts a blanket onto SpongeBob.]
Patrick: Here you go, old friend. [the heart monitor stops beeping] Huh? [groans in sadness and covers SpongeBob up to his face, thinking he has died]
SpongeBob: [wakes up and feels young again] Gotcha!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
Patrick: You got me again. [laughs]
[Meanwhile, Clarabelle is playing Marco Polo with several senior citizens near the coral tree.]
Clarabelle: Marco.
Old Man #3: Polo.
Clarabelle: Marco!
Marco: [climbs down the tree] Oh, that's it! I said I was-a gonna clobber the next-a person what-a calls my name!
Clarabelle: No one clobbers Clarabelle! [flexes her flabby arms and her biceps forms into a scooter with rocket boasters on it; then she gives Marco a knuckle sandwich and sends him flying off distance, exploding on impact] Oh, Marco? [takes out an ear trumpet to hear]
Marco: [weakly] Polo.
[The episode begins with Sandy working on her latest invention in her treedome. SpongeBob, who appears to have a goofy look on his face, is helping.]
Sandy: Laser wrench.
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm. [hands her a hammer]
Sandy: Nope.
SpongeBob: Ah. [hands her a screwdriver]
Sandy: Uh-uh.
SpongeBob: Mm? [hands her a pair of underwear]
Sandy: Not even close.
SpongeBob: [laughs as he paddles Sandy's head with a paddleball]
Sandy: No. No. No.
SpongeBob: Oh! [honks a horn in Sandy's face]
Sandy: [grabs the horn] Ugh, fine! It'll do. [screams the horn on her invention]
[The doorbell rings.]
Sandy: Hm?
SpongeBob: I'll get it! [answers the door and another squirrel comes in]
Rosy Cheeks: Surprise! [removes her diving helmet and her three children enter the treedome] Hi-ya, sis!
Macadamia: [removes her diving helmet] Howdy!
Hazelnut: [removes her diving helmet] Auntie!
Pistachio: [removes her diving helmet] Sandy!
Sandy: Oh! I didn't expect y'all till tomorrow.
Rosy Cheeks: I know how much you love your nieces y'know, so I brought 'em a day early.
Sandy: SpongeBob, this here's my sister, Rosy and my three nieces. [points to her niece in a red dress] This'n here's Macadamia.
Macadamia: [curtsy] How do?
Sandy: [points to her niece in a yellow dress] Hazelnut.
Hazelnut: [twirls around and curtsy] How do?
Sandy: [points to her niece in a green dress] And little Pistachio.
Pistachio: How d—[belches and giggles in embarrassment]
Sandy: Girls, this is my friend, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Aww, what sweet little angels!
Rosy Cheeks: [laughs nervously] Yeah, angels. Okay, well I gotta skedaddle. [puts her diving helmet back on, exits the treedome, inflates her suit, and floats to the surface] Freedom!
Sandy: [talks quietly to SpongeBob] Doggone it. They're too early! I'm not finished with their present!
SpongeBob: [puts on a cowboy hat and a fake mustache] Don't worry your pretty little head, little lady. I'll watch the gals until you're done!
Sandy: [removes SpongeBob's hat and fake mustache] Thanks, SpongeBob, but there's something I gotta tell you about babysitting my—
SpongeBob: [closes Sandy's mouth and chuckles] Yeah, I think I know a little something about babysitting, Sandy.
[A flashback shows SpongeBob babysitting Patrick in his pineapple house. SpongeBob pats Patrick on the back like a baby and Patrick belches. Back in reality, SpongeBob makes hand motions and belches like Patrick.]
SpongeBob: [shrugs in embarrassment] Excuse me.
Sandy: Y'all mind your Uncle SpongeBob now. [takes her invention and heads into her tree]
SpongeBob: [pulls up the picnic table, scoops up the three nieces and sits them down] Story time! [blows up an inflatable book and begins to read it] Goldyfish and the Three Sea Bears. Chapter one, breaking and entering.
Macadamia: [pops the inflatable book and pouts] Don't waste your breath...
Hazelnut: [pouts] And don't make a hassle...
Pistachio: [pouts] Some kids like to read...
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: But we'd rather wrassle!
TV Announcer: Wrassle match!
SpongeBob: Now you girls go easy on me, okay? [giggles]
Macadamia: [arm wrestles SpongeBob and flips him over] One!
[SpongeBob gets up and goes to arm wrestle Hazelnut.]
Hazelnut: [arm wrestles SpongeBob and crushes his hand] Two!
[SpongeBob's hand and fingers is crumbled into dust. SpongeBob waters his hand and it replenishes back to normal. SpongeBob then goes to arm wrestle Pistachio, but she was too strong for him to handle. Pistachio yawns in boredom. She knocks him upward and shatters the picnic table. She throws his severed arm and SpongeBob crashes into Sandy's tree.]
SpongeBob: Ow!
Sandy: [comes out of the tree when she heard the ruckus and shakes her head] Ugh. [picks SpongeBob up and puts him back together as she walks him to the door] Why don't ya show the girls around town?
SpongeBob: Great idea! [places bubbles on their heads so they have enough air to breathe] I'll take them to the funnest place in all of Bikini Bottom!
[The girls merge together and form a huge smile. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab and the girls smile turns into a frown.]
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab! [the girls detach themselves and Mr. Krabs comes in] Mr. Krabs, these are Sandy's little nieces.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, nieces, eh? And what brings such cute little customers to Bikini Bottom?
Macadamia: We're visting Auntie Sandy…
Hazelnut: And we want to sling hash...
Pistachio: A chophouse like this must be...
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: [their eyes have dollar signs on them] Loaded with cash!
Mr. Krabs: Aww! Go on! No, really. Go on.
[Mr. Krabs and the girls stare for a while until they turn and head to the register. Pistachio gives Mr. Krabs a death ray, saying that she's watching him. Squidward is knitting a beautiful sweater for himself at the register.]
SpongeBob: [sneaks up behind Squidward and accidentally causes him to tear his sweater apart] This is my coworker-slash-best buddy, Squidward.
Squidward: Ugh! Children.
Macadamia: Ugh! Grown-ups.
Hazelnut: This feller ain't happy.
Pistachio: Just look at his face.
[Squidward's face appears ugly looking.]
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: We're gonna be sick all over the place!
[Squidward groans. The scene changes to SpongeBob making a meal for the girls in the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Here you go! Three Dolly Patties.
[Hazelnut sprays ketchup into SpongeBob's face to make him look like Mr. Krabs.]
SpongeBob: [imitates Mr. Krabs]
[Hazelnut sprays relish, ketchup and mustard all over the kitchen.]
Squidward: Can you stop playing dress-up long enough to make some Krabby Patties?
[The girls spray mustard into Squidward's face to make him look like SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Huh! Guess that's me all over. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [comes in the kitchen and laughs] You two look ridiculerous!
[The girls spray ketchup, mustard and relish on Mr. Krabs to make him look like Plankton.]
Squidward: Ha! You're your own worst enemy.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, from now on, babysit off Krusty Krab Property! [SpongeBob backs away in embarrassment] And Mr. Squidward, dress like SpongeBob on your own time.
[SpongeBob and the girls exit the restaurant.]
Macadamia: That place really stunk.
Hazelnut: It was lamer than lame.
Pistachio: Take us somewhere fun.
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: [holds up brass knuckles with spikes on them] Or taste Texas pain!
SpongeBob: Aww, what cute little knuckles you have. Hmm, hmm... ooh, I've got just the spot.
[The scene changes to Goo Lagoon. SpongeBob and the girls are in bathing suits.
SpongeBob: [inhales] Ahh, smell that fresh seawater.
[Macadamia taps on the bubble to show SpongeBob they can't smell.]
SpongeBob: Oh, heh-hey, right. Sorry.
[SpongeBob throws the blankets in the air and it magically flips onto the girls. The umbrella lands next to SpongeBob along with the picnic basket and sand bucket. The girls layback and relax in the sun.]
SpongeBob: [yawns] See, Sandy, nothing to worry about. Baby-sitting is eaaaaasy. [falls fast asleep]
[Moments later...]
Macadamia: Hey, Uncle SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh? [closes his eyes]
Hazelnut: Open your eyes!
[SpongeBob wakes up and closes his eyes.]
Pistachio: You're just gonna love...
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Hm? [sees a sandcastle built over him]
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Our sandy surprise!
Macadamia: It's our gift to you!
SpongeBob: Well, isn't that sweet!
Hazelnut: And it won't wash away...!
Pistachio: [holds up a trowel] 'Cause it's made of concrete!
SpongeBob: Concrete, what?! [gets up] Good structural integrity girls, but a little tight!
Macadamia: So, sorry, Uncle.
Hazelnut: We made it too small...
Pistachio: But we'll get you out...
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: With this wrecking ball!
SpongeBob: [Scared] Wrecking what?!
[Pistachio bashes SpongeBob in the head a couple of times, giving him a really long bump on his head. The bump reaches the surface next to Bikini Atoll. A seagull lands on top of the bump. SpongeBob pulls himself out of the sand.]
SpongeBob: [dizzy] Let's all go to my house and take a little break. [moans and walks away with the girls]
[The scene changes to the girls skipping around SpongeBob tying his bump with ribbons.]
SpongeBob: Here we are, girls. Pineapple, sweet pine— [opens the door and Patrick with a horrible look on his face as if he didn't sleep for weeks] Whoa!
Patrick: I've been waiting all day to watch your TV! [backs up inside as his face gets eerie]
[SpongeBob and the girls enter the house.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you could have watched it while I was out.
Patrick: I forgot how to make it work! [shakes SpongeBob's television] Show me! Show me funny! I wanna see stories! Go, go! [sobs] Please!
SpongeBob: [turns the television on] Boop. There you go.
[The television shows a funny black and white comedy show.]
Patrick: [rubs his head and stupidly] I don't know how you remember all this technical stuff.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Patrick, meet Sandy's nieces.
Patrick: [flies over to SpongeBob's chair] Good to meet ya! [sits on the chair]
[A squirrel hand puppet is shown.]
Squirrel hand puppet: [on TV] Hey, kids, know what time it is? [smashes an acorn] It's nutcrackin' time!
Patrick: [giggles] I love this episode!
Macadamia: Well, well, what do you know?
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Patrick is watching our favorite show!
[The girls move over to the television so they can watch it.]
SpongeBob: Ah, finally, I can relax. [holds up a mixer in the kitchen] With work!
[SpongeBob turns on the mixer and starts to make a batter for his brownies. The batter splatters all over the kitchen. SpongeBob licks the batter from his eyes and body. Back in the living room, Patrick is having a hard time seeing the show due to the girls blocking the view. He huffs in anger. He gets up from the chair to see the show. But Pistachio's tail blocks his face. He moves himself and the chair in front so he can see.]
Patrick: Ah, that's better.
[The girls growl angrily. They move themselves in front of Patrick and stack each other up.]
Patrick: [angrily] Aww!
[Patrick hops his chair in front of the girls. He laughs at the show. The girls climb onto Patrick so they can see the television. Patrick growls angrily and activates the chair's lever to get the girls off. He snickers evilly and scoots himself in front of the television.]
Macadamia: Let's launch this goof...
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Right to the roof!
Macadamia: [chuckles as she grabs the chair's lever] Lift-off!
[Macadamia launches Patrick upwards and the girls laugh.]
Patrick: [flies through the roof] Whoo! [falls back down] Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: [comes in with a plate full of brownies] Who wants brownies? [Patrick falls on SpongeBob and eats the brownies before bouncing backwards] Heh. I'll go make another batch.
[The girls laugh at the show before Patrick falls back onto the chair.]
Macadamia: Let's send this nitwit...
Hazelnut: On his way!
Pistachio: Before he ruins our whole dern day!
Macadamia: [holds up a hangman's noose] Yeah!
[The girls merge together and form a huge evil smile. The scene changes Pistachio tying a rope to the end of the bus.]
Bus driver: All aboard for Glove World!
[Macadamia ties the rope to Patrick and the chair. The bus begins to drive away and drags Patrick with the chair.]
Patrick: Save me a brownie!
Macadamia: He'll be away...
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: The whole dern day!
[The girls fistbump and proceed to watch television. But much to their misfortune, Patrick returns with a group of people wearing gloves on their heads.]
Patrick: Hi! I brought some friends.
[Patrick and everyone else enter the house and move in front of the television, blocking the girls' view once again. SpongeBob comes back in with a new batch of brownies.]
SpongeBob: [sees more people in his house] Ooh! I'll have to make more brownies! [goes back in the kitchen]
Macadamia: [fed up with Patrick's stupidity and selfishness] All y'all shoo! You're blocking our view!
Bikini Bottomites: [nervously back away] Excuse us. Sorry. Sorry, ma'am.
Hazelnut: We're taking that seat...
Pistachio: Right where you sit!
Patrick: What you gonna do?
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Let's wrassle for it!
TV Announcer: Wrassle match!
SpongeBob: [as the referee] Ready, set...wrassle!
[The bell rings. Patrick and the girls struggle with all their might. They both look as they were equally matched due to their strength. But just as the girls were about to win, Patrick spots a brownie on the table.]
Patrick: Ooh, brownie! [slaps the girls' hands down on the table, which inexplicably helps him win the match]
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Huh?
Patrick: You saved me one! Thanks! [eats the brownie] Guess I get the TV. [chuckles evilly]
Macadamia: That guy's mean!
Hazelnut: Where's our auntie?!
Pistachio: We gon' leave!
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: [tears fill up their bubbles as they cry] We want Sandy!
[The girls run back to Sandy's treedome, crying their eyes out.]
Macadamia: Oh, Auntie Sandy, what a terrible place!
Hazelnut: Everyone was so mean!
Pistachio: Right to our face!
Sandy: [sympathetically] Aw, don't fret, little ladies. I made a present just for you, [pops Macadamia's bubble] you, [pops Hazelnut's bubble] and you. [pops Pistachio's bubble]
[Sandy pushes the button on the invention she was working on and it forms into a castle-shaped bouncing house.]
Macadamia: From a rattlesnake's tail...
Hazelnut: To an armadillo's chest...
Pistachio: Our Auntie Sandy...
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Is the gol'durn best!
[The girls go and play on the bounce house just as SpongeBob enters the treedome.]
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Sandy. [begins to dry up due to not wearing a water helmet] I guess I'm just not a very good babysitter.
Sandy: [puts a water helmet on SpongeBob] I tried to tell ya the first rule of babysitting my nieces.
SpongeBob: What's that?
Sandy: Don't babysit my nieces!
[SpongeBob smiles in embarrassment, since he should of listened to Sandy in the first place. Sandy pushes another button and turns the bounce house into an inflatable submarine, trapping the girls inside.]
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Bye, Auntie Sandy! Bye, Uncle SpongeBob!
[The submarine exits the treedome and floats away to the surface. SpongeBob and Sandy wave goodbye. But despite everything SpongeBob went through with them, his eyes teared up as he smiles happily.]
Sandy: Bye-bye! Have a nice trip back to Texas! [quietly whispers to SpongeBob] Bless their evil little hearts.
[Back in Texas, Rosy is submerged in a pool relaxing as she is enjoying her time off from her children.]
Rosy Cheeks: Ahhh…. [the submarine's shadow looms over her; she gasps] Oh, no.
[The submarine crashes on top of Rosy and her children are happily bouncing up and down in front of her.]
Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Hiya, Ma! Did ya miss us?
[Rosy sighs in distraught and the episode ends.]
